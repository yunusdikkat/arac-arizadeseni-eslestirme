"Feb 11","2021","Model S P85+","All Suspension Components On Verge Of Failure","53,037 miles","All of the suspension components needed to be replaced due to failure. Tesla's service bulletin was shown and they fixed the rear free of cost. They forced me to pay out of pocket for the front and did not apply their second service bulletin towards the suspension problem. There are several law suites due to the engineering design flaws associated with this."
