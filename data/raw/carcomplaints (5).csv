"Aug 15","2018","A4 Quattro","Excessive Oil Usage","54,000 miles","By far the least reliable car I've ever owned. I've owned Hyundai, Honda, Kia, Nissan, and Geo! I've put more money into my ONE 2011 Audi A4 than all the other cars combined. No joke. In the four years I've owned my Audi, I've had to replace: all the fuel injectors, the intake manifold (twice), ignition coil, and now a cylinder head repair that will cost over $3,900 alone to fix. This is also the most fun car to drive I've ever owned, but because used cars are SO expensive right now - I'm stuck with this one. With all the repairs I've done - I'm just holding on to the false hope it actually will go a year without breaking down again. It's been undrivable every year that I've owned it, each year at least once. Oh, and it burns oil - about a 1/3 of a quart every 800 miles or so. Get used to seeing the 'low oil' indicator light."
"Dec 22","2019","A4 Prestige 2.0L","Excessive Oil Usage","104,700 miles","I bought this car for my 16 year old in October 2019 from Bob Moore Audi. Before purchasing the car, I asked the service manager what problems they saw. The burning of the oil was never mentioned and I have now called Bob Moore to speak with the service manager. My daughter barely drove it because she didn't have her license yet and around Christmas the low oil light came on. I added a quart and contacted my mechanic. We have had the oil changed, and she hasn't driven it 1,000 miles since the oil change - and the light is on again She has barely driven it 2,000 miles since I bought the car for her. Now, I am finding out that this type of engine is known for burning oil. So why did the dealership not disclose this when I asked them about the history, and is this going to be a major issue that I need to find my daughter another car?"
"Nov 02","2020","A4 2L T Quattro","Excessive Oil Usage","64,312 miles","I bought this car used... I just want it fixed and I think Audi knew of the piston ring problems in 2008 from forums I have read. Please help! I cannot afford to fix this issue. I had a Honda before this and never had any issues with it. My Honda was written off through no fault of my own and I decided to buy used. Big mistake with the Audi oil burner... great ride, though."
"Jul 26","2019","A4 2.0t","Excessive Oil Usage","67,000 miles","We were driving in the mountains near Denver and while going down a steep descent, we experienced heavy vibration when braking (probably a warped rotor). This problem is unrelated to the complaint but it prompted me to go through the car's computer menu where I discovered there was no oil in the engine. Normally the computer gives us a low oil warning but we didn't receive any such warning since the last oil change at 64,315 miles. There are now approximately 67,000 miles on the vehicle. I would have caught this sooner if I'd been able to check the oil manually but the geniuses at Audi decided not to put a dip stick on this car. The only way to know your oil level is low is for the car's computer to tell you, either with a dashboard warning, which we didn't receive, or by going through the computer menu. Oil level is the only information the computer gives you. It tells you nothing about the quality of the oil in the engine (is it dirty, gummy, etc.). There's a class action lawsuit against this model, which was settled around five years ago. I didn't apply for compensation prior to the application period for compensation expiring, because I wasn't having any oil issues until now."
"Nov 15","2018","A4 2.0L","Excessive Oil Usage","58,000 miles","Audi has fault in this type of model. I believe they never pay much attention on engine reliability, always focus on performance, additional features. I will NEVER, EVER, EVER in my life buy this crap, ever."
"Apr 20","2019","A4 2.0L Turbo","Excessive Oil Usage","92,000 miles","Since I bought my car in 2013 I have had to take it to the dealership to get the oil topped off at 500 miles. My low oil light would always come on. I have since had several oil consumption tests and all parts changed out from all settlements yet my car remained to burn oil too rapidly and I have since took it into the dealership because 'check engine"" light came on and ""oil pressure too low' came on sometimes when I would turn. I have all service records to support me bringing my car to the dealership several times to solve this oil problem. No solution. My oil sensors were just changed Jan 2019 and a few months later when I would turn it told me my oil was too low. The light would pop up quick and go away. This happened 3 more times in one day and I checked it every time I checked it it said it was 3/4 full. I was baffled. The only thing I could think of was the oil sensor that was replaced wasn't giving a proper reading. I quickly pulled over to buy oil since it was an hour away from the dealership. bought a quart of oil and checked the oil. This time it said the oil was bone dry. I added a quart and tried starting the car yet it wouldn't start it sounded like it was going to start but wouldn't turn over.I panicked. I called the dealership before they left for the day and explained what was going on and verified that they had in fact changed the sensor which was called ""Oil Pressure Switch"". They said to have it towed in and so I had it towed in after hours-Fri night. I called several times yet it was a Sat; therefore, I didn't hear from them until Tuesday. They said I needed a new Timing chain and a few days later they said I need a new engine. They said they don't know how it happened and in order to take the engine apart it would be over $2500 and replacing the engine will cost me $15k."
"Aug 01","2018","A4","Excessive Oil Usage","50,000 miles","A4 2011 model was consuming oil very frequently. They did some oil test and finally replaced most of the parts like piston, ring and tension-er and other parts to fix the issue. Hopefully I can keep this vehicle for another 50K miles without any other problems."
"Dec 17","2016","A4 A4 2.0L Tfsi","Excessive Oil Usage","80,000 miles","When I first bought my car at 80,000 miles it leaked from the valve cover. Didn't see it because it was later in the evening when I bought it. After 2,000 miles I noticed my oil light come on. At this point I put oil in it and fixed the valve cover since it was a bit bent. No more leaks but still uses of quite a bit of oil. I used to travel for my job and always carried a jug of oil with me. I do my own work and maintenance so I know the ins and outs of my car.Now at 113,000 and still been adding oil till this day. I've looked everywhere for a solution and it's all the same thing to take it into the dealership. Not happy. Last time I had them do my timing chain with new guides they over filled my oil and my car ran like crap and was jerking.I did a recent tune up on it so I knew it wasn't anything I did. Even did an oil change before it went in. Just for the hell of it I decided to do another oil change which old had about 100 miles on. Well somehow I end up draining 10 quarts of oil out of my car and noticed it was leaking from the transmission oil cooler. It was a puddle of oil. I loosen all my oil lines and re-attached them and the leak went away. Dealership over filled my oil without draining it. Didn't have time to go back due to traveling for job. I was away for a whole month."
"Jan 01","2015","A4 ES 2.0L","Excessive Oil Usage","66,000 miles","I called and called the dealership about the car using oil excessively... they kept telling me it was normal... I'm not a mechanic, but I know using 2 quarts plus in 5k miles is something wrong. I started reporting it before the car had 40k miles on it... then I filled out the paperwork for the lawsuit.... my car is a 2011.. when I got the paperwork in the mail that lawsuit was won .. I called. my car had 82K miles on it. they said they couldn't do anything because it was 2k over the limit granted in the lawsuit. WHAT? this is ridiculous. this car now has 99K miles on it and uses a quart of oil every 1k miles. biggest disappointment from any car and manufacturer I have ever heard of . to me this is totally unacceptable!!!!!!!!"
"Jan 01","2015","A4","Excessive Oil Usage","85,000 miles","Engine was replaced and still continues to consume excessive amounts of oil. Not covered under warranty anymore so I'm not sure what my options are now. I have to add a quart of oil every 200 to 300 miles."
"Sep 15","2016","A4 Prestige","Excessive Oil Usage","83,000 miles","Bought the car used from Audi of Nashua NH, they said it was perfect. Then after the 4th time in at Fathers and Sons in West Springfield MA they said the time to fix expired in July 2017, funny I bought the car in August 2017. The MA dealer said the NH dealer should have known and fixed it since they had it while covered, instead they lied and passed it on to me. Never going to buy another Audi! They don't stand by their cars."
"Mar 04","2017","A4","Excessive Oil Usage","98,000 miles","I have always been diligent about having my car serviced when needed. I always have had the oil changed or added when needed. My car has been burning excessive oil and my husband has been having to add oil every week it seemed. Finally, my husband and I were out to breakfast and got in my car to drive home and it was idling very rough which resulted in it not driving forward or in reverse. The result was having it towed to the mechanic where the diagnosis was I needed a new engine. Not at all happy!! I've never had to replace an engine in a car and my car has been babied and well taken care of."
"Sep 05","2016","A4 2.0L","Excessive Oil Usage","77,000 miles","October 4, 2014 I purchased from Boardwalk Auto in Redwood City, CA a used 2011 Audi A4 Wagon Avant Quattro with about 75,400 miles on it on August 7, 2016 . Very clean nice ride but it burns oil like crazy! Iâ€™m now at 79,765 and have put in my 7th quart of oil. I noticed on the site that there was a problem with the some models up to 2010; can I learn more about this? Also why is there no Dip Stick and from where should I get one?"
"Jun 21","2016","A4 A-4 2.0L","Excessive Oil Usage","21,828 miles","In Dec. 2010 I purchased a new 2011 Audi A-4 and loved the car although I did not drive it much as I had problems with my back and wintered in Fla. When I returned in May and drove my new car approx. 4500 miles, I notice the oil light had come on, read the manual and check with the dealer and he said to add oil as it is normal for high performance engines. I did and noticed that approx. every 1500 miles the oil gauge was coming on. I spoke with them again and brought it in for an oil change at 10,000 miles as I felt it was due.Once again they assured me nothing wrong, normal. I had it serviced at 15,000 miles again no problem, just add oil when the light comes on. On June 21, 2016 with 21,828 miles on the vehicle I brought it in for an oil change but to a different dealership Herb Chambers in Burlington. They told me that the some of the 2009 & 2011 had problems with using excessive oil and they could do a test but I would have to bring it back after I put 2000 miles on it for the second test. When I brought it back with 24,765 miles on it the oil gauge was down.They performed the second portion of the test on Sept. 28, 2016 and today is Oct 5 and I still have not rec'd my car back. I did call them on Sept 30 to see when it would be ready and they said they were waiting to hear back from Audi in Michigan as this is a $4000 job and they want to make sure it will be covered."
"Jul 01","2014","A4 2.0L","Excessive Oil Usage","30,000 miles","Started slow, now I am using about 1 quart of oil every 750 miles. I have oil on the floor of the garage at the bottom of the exhaust pipes. And I always have an extra quart of oil in the trunk for safety."

"Sep 28","2015","A4 2.0t","Excessive Oil Usage","87,000 miles","This is a story of true contrasting Audi dealership in Michigan. One dealership honored warranty repairs without any cost while another dealership tried to charge huge amount for the same warranty repair. One dealership showed high standard of professionalism in maintain Audiâ€™s reputation while another dealership is spoiling Audiâ€™s reputation by cheating and insulting the customer. Following two scenarios explains the case:Scenario 1: Suburban Farmington Hills Audi, MI I had a dream to buy an Audi car since my high school days. It took ten years to fulfill the dream when I purchase Audi 2011 A4 2.0T in Connecticut September 22, 2015. Underwent thorough inspection of the car, oil change/filter change and other fluid top-offs and thorough inspection at Hoffman East Hartford Audi, Connecticut on September 24, 2015. I took Audi from Connecticut to Michigan traveling 800 miles. After 1st week of purchase of this mint-conditioned Audi with new oil change and service, I saw oil level sign bright red on my dashboard, signaling â€œplease add oil (max 1 quart).â€ I was shocked to learn about that warning sign because after new oil change service the oil is supposed to last more than 10,000 miles. But my oil thirsty Audi car started craving for new oil within 800 miles of journey, without any obvious sign of oil leakage."
"Oct 01","2013","A4 Front Track","Excessive Oil Usage","40,000 miles","Audi from 2009 - 2011 made cars with oil consumption problems, to which there was a class action law suit filed. My car was tested and goes through one quart of oil every 1000 miles..... RIDICULOUS! They would only pay for half of this $3,500 repair, due to the mileage - however I had been informing my Audi dealership (Audi Raleigh) of this issue for MONTHS prior to receiving the class action law suit.They are not only terrible cars, but their management is faulty, and the way their treat their customers is less that satisfactory. needless to say - i will never buy another Audi, and i would recommend you don't either."
"Jan 02","2012","A4 2.0L","Excessive Oil Usage","81,000 miles","My 2011 Audi has burned oil, every 2500 miles, from the get go. I brought it to the dealer and they did a consumption test Phase 1 and Phase 2 in 2012. They said it was normal. Recently I have had to add oil every 600 miles. I just called the dealer. They said because I did the test in 2012 and it came back normal, there is nothing they can do. What a crock! I will never buy an Audi again."
"Jul 30","2014","A4 Quattro 2.0L","Excessive Oil Usage","65,678 miles","Car is using oil every 800 miles, just not right.Had it serviced at a qualified Audi dealership from day one.They never mentioned this problem."
