"Aug 13","2022","A4 2.0L","Engine Failure","75,390 miles","I bought this car from Carvana June 15 2022 and on April 15 2022 the engine failed without warning. I am waiting for a response from Silver Rock warranty company to see if it will be paid for. It took them 6 hours to get a tow truck on the way. Before they informed me of the tow I had already found a tow, it took me 20 min. I am not sure who's fault, it is Audi or Carvana, but as of now I am out over 20K for this car. Carvana has been the worst car buying experience that I have ever been through. We will see if they resolve this issue or not, I will post another when and if it is.So it's been 6 mo and i still do not have my car back Carvana and silverrock don't seem to care about the customer after they get there money, i have lost my job and can't look for another one until i get transportation do to the fact i live in a rual area. Day after day week after week month after month i have been waiting still no car."
"Jan 12","2022","A4 2.0t","Engine Failure","110,170 miles","I purchased this car January 12th 2022. The CVT was slipping. Took it to a mechanic. THE F* ENGINE HAS NO PRESSURE ON CYLINDER 2. The mechanic looked further. There's a broken piston ring. The car is undrivable. Seriously I have to tow this POS. I started googling and found that there's a class action suit because Audi KNEW about this problem. I want in. I basically just want the money back I paid for this steaming white dog turd."
"Dec 01","2021","A4 2.0L","Engine Failure","96,000 miles","Timing chain failed as caused damage to the engine. Mechanic is suggesting complete engine replacement."
"Oct 09","2017","A4 Premium 2.0t","Engine Failure","59,000 miles","I purchased a slightly used 2013 A4, 20K miles. As I was driving from the gym to my home at about 35mph, I felt the car losing power, then check engine light. I continued driving the next half mile to home. I used my own check engine device and I get engine misfire codes. I was thinking it could be a bad spark plug. I called the dealer and he asked me to bring it over to check. The nearest dealer was 100 miles away, so I towed there and waited for diagnosis.They found that a broken piston ring was causing chamber low pressure. The only solution is replace the entire engine, because it's cheaper than trying to repair. The engine would cost $13,000 including install!! My heart dropped that moment. Luckily I found that I have a third party extended warranty. The fight with the third party took about three months to convince them about the issue because they wanted the dealer to open the engine so they can see the root cause of the failure. I denied the request because if they open the engine end they end up denying the repair for any reason, I will have to pay the man hour for it.After persistence, they decided to replace my engine with a used engine that they sent to the dealer, so I was okay with it since I just need the car on the road and I intended to sell it anyway.I paid $100 deductibles and took my car. After driving the car for few days I started noticing clicking noise when I push the gas a little hard. After couple weeks I traded it for Toyota. NO MORE AUDI! as much as i love them"
"Sep 17","2015","A4 Premium 2.0L T","Engine Failure","116,017 miles","$8,978 was the cost of the last 2.0 Turbo engine Replacement about 5 months ago. I went with a Used engine with 9,000 miles on it, and I've put about 25,000 miles on that engine. It was fine for the first 10,000 miles then starting using oil.Just like the last one.I am a Public Relations Nightmare for Audi USA. I see young high income demographic buyers all day long and they ask me how I like my Audi. I tell them, and they decide not to buy one. See my previous posting about the first engine replacement.I am looking at an additional $9,000 - $15,000 engine replacement cost on a 2 year old car I still owe $22,000 on and will have about $25,000 into 2 engine replacements in a year's time.So I am wedded to Audi for a while. Wait until I get going with an Audi Engines Suck website. Search Engine optimized of Course, so it comes up in the top 5 or 10 every search on all search engines."
"Mar 10","2015","A4 Premium 2.0L T","Engine Failure","89,662 miles","Audi has had a known problem with PISTON RINGS for a long, long time, as in, many years. Other websites claim a 1 in 27 engine failure rate, by the Auto Warranty writers, for the Audi High Compression engines with Turbo's..The 2.0 Turbo is an engine Audi and Volkswagen are putting in many, many cars and SUVs. The 2.0 T in this car has now had it's second engine failure due to rings, in a year, and I am going in to the dealer to discuss it. It's out of warranty, was just barely out of warranty when it failed the first time, and will require a complete engine replacement.Further, I am a public relations nightmare for Audi USA. I see high income demographic buyers in my regular work all day long 5 and 6 days a week, and they ask "" How do you like your Audi A4 ? I tell them, "" it's like a bad girl friend. Very exciting car to drive, you drive it easy, you care for it, take it places, give it status, give it lots of Money and Love. ... It just won't love you back. 2 Engine replacements due to piston/ring failure and the car is 2 years old $9000 to $15000 engine replacement.I probably discourage between 5 and 10 people a week who were just going to buy an Audi from Buying one. And guess how many people they tell ? Guess what I tell the Audi Owners to do who also ask ? When the car starts using a lot of oil, complain like hell, insist on a compression test BEFORE the warranty period is up, and get a lawyer. Several have."
