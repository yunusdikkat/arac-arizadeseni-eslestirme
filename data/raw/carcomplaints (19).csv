"Oct 01","2018","Forester 2.5L V4","High Oil Consumption","90,000 miles","This car burns oil like crazy - and you sure can smell it! I have to manually add oil every 1000 miles or so. The oil light comes on and scares the hell out of me on every road trip. The oil light consitantly comes on after 2ish hours of driving."
"Jul 01","2014","Forester Premium 2.5L","High Oil Consumption","1,500 miles","A brand new car, and I had to add a quart of oil every 1,000 miles. Traded the car in for a 2015 Forester after dealer told me this was ""normal""."
"Nov 17","2017","Forester 2.5i Premium Sport Utility 4D 4-cyl, Pzev, 2.5L","High Oil Consumption","88,000 miles","I am not really adding anything new here, other than that I have to put a quart of oil into my Forester every tank of gas."
"Dec 02","2019","Forester Limited 2.5L","High Oil Consumption","78,000 miles","Car would consume oil only when driving in interstate. Would loose a quart about every 700 miles. Oil would become black."
"Apr 01","2019","Forester","High Oil Consumption","50,000 miles","This year and Vin has a reported oil consumption issue, which causes a noise in the engine. However, my local dealership is denying there is a problem. They ran their test for oil consumption - the car  scored just a few numbers under what would have deemed it a need for a repair covered by their warranty. As it is, it's an engine noise they say will cost $5000 of my dollars (not covered) to fix. Shady all around!"
"Aug 08","2017","Forester","High Oil Consumption","80,000 miles","I kept wondering why I was having to drive around with quarts of oil in my car, so I stopped and asked one day. I found out there was a recall. The dealership had to replace the motor."
"Apr 15","2016","Forester","High Oil Consumption","26,000 miles","Please do not buy a 2014 Subaru Forester. My car was subject to the recall due to the oil consumption problem, but after having the ""test' to see if my car was, in fact, one of the affected, I was told ""no."" As the years went by, I had to have the oil checked before any extended car trip. Even with that, the oil lamp was lighting up when I was on the AC Expressway or the NJ Turnpike near New York or I95 down south. I could never be certain that I wouldn't be stranded due to the oil problem. I even had the test done twice. It was the piston which eroded all the more as the years went by. I was in touch with Subaru at all levels of the organization. I was also a loyal Subaru customer- this being my 3rd or 4th Subaru. Well, sadly for Subaru, instead of my continued praises, it is getting my warning. The 2014 Forester is a disaster where oil is concerned. If you don't want to have to put oil in every 1500 - 2000 miles, I urge you to steer clear of this car."
"Sep 03","2018","Forester 2.5 Premium 2.5L H4","High Oil Consumption","56,000 miles","Buying a newer used car should have no problems, but not with this one. I have noticed that when I change my oil it's a lot less than I pour into the engine. I did a little research and stumbled across this problem, I wasn't the only one with the engine consuming oil. I would have thought Subaru would have fixed these problems but according to them that is ""normal"". Subaru is doing nothing to fix the problem, I'm stuck with it for now but next time I will have to consider buying a Toyota."
"Jun 11","2018","Forester EX","High Oil Consumption","64,000 miles","Brought my car into Maita Subaru last week for just an OIL CHANGE & was told to bring it back in 1200 miles cause my car is running about a quart low of oil & if it is still doing it in 1200 miles than I need to have my motor replaced & was informed Subaru would pay for this. Is it true that Subaru is going to pay for my motor to be replaced if it needs it? Yet when they did the oil change the reminder sticker that they put on my windshield does not reflect to bring it in in 1,200 miles it says to bring it in in the usual mileage amount."
"Dec 13","2016","Forester","High Oil Consumption","100,000 miles","Purchased new Forester and I put a lot of highway miles on it from day one. I can't remember when the car didn't consume oil. But, getting about 28mpg hwy and seeing no puddles on the ground, I continued adding oil until it got to where I was adding 1 qt. every 1,000 to 1,200 miles. That's when I read about the recall and took it in to get an oil consumption test just before the 100k warranty expired. Miraculously, the car burned no oil according to this test! By then, I had stopped the highway driving, which they told me contributed to the problem."
"Mar 02","2016","Forester","High Oil Consumption","40,000 miles","Check oil light started coming on a month after getting the oil changed at dealer. All service has been done at the dealer. First thought the dealer was not filling Oil level enough, I live about 20 miles from the dealer so I topped off the oil myself. This happened two more times. I then had my wife bring into the dealer. They Topped off for free but said that it pretty normal. We noticed this has happened to many other Forester owners and Now feel like we may have a more serious issue."
"Mar 01","2017","Forester 2.5I","High Oil Consumption","51,450 miles","check engine light on"
"Oct 16","2016","Forester Limited 2.5i","High Oil Consumption","46,000 miles","In 2014 I purchased a Forester Limited very well equipped because my daughter has purchased an early 2014 Forester Premium very well equipped. After we got the car we realized that it was not very sound proof and that road and wind noise was more than we expected. In addition, we paid a hefty sum for the navigation system that we quit using because it sent us to strange places, sometimes on the other side of town. It also did not have major highways shown on the map. Too often it showed us driving through uncharted land. When my daughter stopped by and told me she had an engine oil light on, I checked her oil and it was down 1 quart. I told her she needed to check it out with the Subaru dealer. The next day I received the letter in the mail about the class action lawsuit on the poorly designed motor. I read the letter that claimed Subaru knew of the design defect in their motors and, essentially they would be punished if the judge accepted the settlement. That is essentially, they will extend the warranty on motor, etc. on effected cars to 100,000. Sounds fair, but unfortunately, the definition and determination was to be left up to the dealers to follow Subaru Guidelines if they wanted to be paid for work. In jest, I told my wife that they will be doing oil consumption tests and will be overfilling the oil. So, I asked my daughter to stop by after the dealer said she needed to do an oil consumption test - and they changed the oil. She stopped by - what do you think I found after 4-5 checks of oil level. The oil was overfilled by a little more than 1/2 quart. Obviously, when she returned to the dealership after 2000 miles (or was it 1500) she was told that its oil consumption was not a problem. My daughter unloaded on the dealership. Strange, but the bought the 100,000 mile warranty when they bought the car."
"Mar 15","2015","Forester Limited","High Oil Consumption","22,000 miles","The oil light came on, I immediately took it to the dealer. The dealer filled it up again and do the consumption test. I went back to the dealer after 1200 and the test was negative. About a year later the oil light came on again. Took it back to dealer and did the consumption test again. Went back to the dealer and the test was negative again. Five months later the oil light came on again. I called Subaru America but they won't do anything. They told me that I have to deal with the dealer. So I took it to the dealer and they replaced the oil level sensor."
"Oct 09","2015","Forester","High Oil Consumption","92,000 miles","This is my second Subaru. The first was an Impreza and I like the brand because I go into the mountains for hiking and skiing. I noticed the engine was running rough. I checked the dip stick and it was dry. I added 1 qt. of oil, ran the engine and checked the dipstick again. It was a still dry. I added a 2nd qt. of oil, ran the engine and checked the dipstick. There was oil at the bottom of the dipstick, below the oil markers. Not believing what was happening made sense I bought another qt. of oil and drove off."
"May 01","2015","Forester 2.5L","High Oil Consumption","20,000 miles","This car is mainly for around town with some trips. I have a second car for all my short around town driving. The oil light came on and I checked the oil.....nearly 2 qts low!"
"Jul 01","2014","Forester Limited 2.5L","High Oil Consumption","16,000 miles","I WAS WARNED-NOT TO BUY A CVT EQUIPPED CAR, BUT STILL GIVEN POSITIVE REMARKS BY OTHERS ABOUT SUBARUS IN GENERAL-WE HAD A 2003 FORESTER WHICH HAD A DYING TRANSMISSION BY 115K MI APPROX., BUT I GUESS THE PRICE POINTS WHEN WE WERE LOOKING AT CRV/RAV MADE US SHOOT INTO THE LOCAL SUBARU DEALER, AND WAIT ALMOST A MONTH FOR THE CAR, A LIMITED."
"Feb 11","2015","Forester Premium 2.5L","High Oil Consumption","20,000 miles","At approximately 20,000 miles, the low oil warning light came on while driving. Got the car home and checked the oil and it barely registered on the dipstick. Added a quart and that brought the level back to the normal operating mark on dipstick. It had only been 4,000 miles since my previous oil change. I had changed the oil at 16K and used Valvoline Synthetic 00W-20 as specified and replaced the oil filter with a Bosch filter."
"Apr 18","2014","Forester 2.5i Premium 2.5L","High Oil Consumption","2,000 miles","I bought my High Oil Consumption 2014 Forester in March of 2014. Subaru replaced the short block in September of 2014 for excessive oil consumption, about 1 quart in 2000 miles. With the new short block the car is worse. It now burns 1 quart in 1300 miles. Waiting to hear back from Subaru. I donâ€™t think Subaru really has a fix for this. Is anyone out there actually going the recommended change interval without having to add oil?"
"Jul 02","2013","Forester 2.5L $ cyl","High Oil Consumption","11,500 miles","I leased Subaru Forester 2014 in July 2013. The Engine Oil warning lamp is on when the car has 2,600 mileage. Drove to dealer, dealer refill engine oil, about another 2,000 miles, engine oil low again."
