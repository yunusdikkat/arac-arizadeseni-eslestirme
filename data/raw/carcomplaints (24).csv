"Aug 01","2007","Monte Carlo LS 3.4L","Intake Gasket Failure","60,000 miles","Needless to say I had to replace the gasket twice. GM finally came out with a differant gasket to fix the problem. The problem was the Dexcool antifreeze was eating through the gaskets. The created a new gasket and created a new antifreeze that you can use in any vehicle. There was a class action lawsuit against GM. We all had to produce reciepts for the repairs which I had. Low and behold everyone got screwed out of their money when GM went bankrupt. This also happened on my 97 GrandAm."
"Nov 20","2008","Monte Carlo SS 3.8L V6","Intake Gasket Failure","52,096 miles","Well it appears that the verdict is in! GM and Chevrolet have a serious problem with their Monte Carlo and Malibu models! Across the board, right at 50k miles the intake manifold gasket is set to blow. I guess that is why their warranty is only 3yrs/36k miles. Its no wonder why they are no longer competitive in the auto industry. When compared to the 10yr/100k mile warranties out there, their 3/36 warranty speaks volumes about the reliability of their cars. Lesson learned!"
"Feb 04","2008","Monte Carlo 3.4L","Intake Gasket Failure","50,000 miles","starts out my oil is gone- take it in -my intake gasket is shot- 3 months later my air compressor is shot and engine is still leaking oil- $3,000 into it so far- I tried to trade the piece of c in but my credit is shot now- I hate chevy they are the worst never again --- 50,000 miles it should be running like a charm- lol -not a john deer 5 horse piece of garbage"
"May 01","2008","Monte Carlo LS 3.4L","Intake Gasket Failure","58,409 miles","Please let this be a lesson to everyone thinking General Motors has fixed their problems...they haven't. I recently had the intake gasket repaired on my 2002 Olds Alero...under Warranty. They told me my 2003 Monte Carlo would not have the same problem as they fixed it forever...new threaded bolts blah..blah..blah! Guess what? It went and out of Warranty. Guess again.....i traded it in, now thay can have their Chevy junk back and I will never never never buy G.M. again. I bought a brand new 2008 Honda Accord and hope to never see the repair guys like i got to know them at the G.M. Dealership. Now to get rid of the Alero and G.M. forever."
