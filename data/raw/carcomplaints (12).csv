"Mar 15","2025","Sorento SX 3.3L","Engine Blown","55,145 miles","The little old lady vehicle. Original owner, services done when needed. 55145 miles and the engine is failing. KIA says no warranty in effect. This is bullshit. Customer never got any notices or letters in the mail. This is not right!! Where is a woman, on fixed income going to get the money to fix it? Who has $15k just sitting around? Any help or advice would be helpful."
"Feb 10","2025","Sorento 4 cyl","Engine Blown","130,000 miles","Engine just died. According to KIA mechanic they have bad connector rod bearings and this is what went bad."
"Nov 13","2020","Sorento Sport V6","Engine Blown","105,000 miles","This was the blown head gaskets under the extended warranty. It was fixed for my portion of 335.00 - then 5 months later the rings went out completely. The cost to replace engine with a used 63,000 engine was $8700."
"Aug 16","2022","Sorento SX 3.3L","Engine Blown","92,118 miles","I was on vacation in the GaspÃ© area (about 950km away from home)... the engine (V6 3.3L) failed completed... it had a terrible knocking noise, and I just managed to get the vehicle to the Kia dealership in GaspÃ©."
"Apr 29","2022","Sorento EX 3.3L V6","Engine Blown","119,000 miles","I bought a used 2014 3.3L V6 Kia Sorento EX. I hadn't even driven 1000 miles and it started over heating. Took it in and thermostat was replaced. Fine for about a week and then started over heating again. Was told that I had a blown head gasket. OK - I understand just bad luck and sometimes that happens. During repair they discovered head bolt threads were stripped from aluminum block and I would have to have an engine replacement. Kia quoted me a price of 11,500.00. I still owe 13,000.00 on the car because I had just bought it. I don't know what I am going to do. It has been a financial disaster that I can't recover from."
"May 08","2022","Sorento LX 3.2L V6","Engine Blown","100,000 miles","The car began to have a knock. We took it to our mechanic who stated the engine was blown. Called the local dealership and Kia both. SO SORRY - you're the second owner and there is no warranty. Estimated cost to replace engine is over $7K."
"Oct 09","2021","Sorento 2.4L","Engine Blown","140,000 miles","I was driving at the time that my check engine light came on the dash board. I immediately stopped the car tuened off the engine and proceeded to look under the hood for any obvious issues. I didn't see anything so I tried to restart my car with no luck. The car have never ran again. I still owe on this car and it no longer runs. I have taken it to 2 different mechanics and they both stated the engine has locked up on this car."
"Dec 23","2020","Sorento LX V6","Engine Blown","104,500 miles","We only bought this car 3 years ago and today we were told that the engine fell apart and the it would cost 13,000 to fix it! The thing that is frustrating and scary is that there were no warning lights, nothing to indicate that there was an issue. We took it in for regular maintenance and would have addressed any issues if we knew about them - it was one minute itâ€™s fine, the next the engine needs to be replaced!"
"Dec 07","2020","Sorento LX 3.3L V6","Engine Blown","155,048 miles","The problem started after I decided to start taking the Sorento LX V6 3.3L into the dealership shop to make sure it gets serviced by the ""right professionals"". It has been at least two consecutive and maybe three times that I have had oil changes at this Kia dealership. I was told that there was very little oil left in the motor. I was confused as this was the first time I have heard this and I have used Good year, Firestone and a couple of other local shops service the car previously. The vehicle was making rattling noises coming from the engine shortly after getting an oil change so I took it back to the dealership shop. The service Advisor tells me that I'm low on oil. I said, how could I be low on oil when I had it serviced here at this shop?"
"Sep 22","2019","Sorento V6","Engine Blown","86,130 miles","I had the engine blow in my Kia sorento, due to a Factory recall in the engine block, Kia is refusing to honor the recall or give me any compensation, the car has been in the shop for 5 weeks now, no replacement car, no offers from kia for aid, nothing! I still have yet to get it back, I had to take it to an auto body shop as Kia wanted almost 9 grand for it, when this is also a rebuilt 0 mile engine, I am furious with kia, and never recommend them to anyone..."
"Jul 30","2018","Sorento LX 4","Engine Blown","90,000 miles","The engine was inspected under the warranty recall. The service guys told us we could replace at the time or wait to see what happens. They thought the vehicle seemed ok. I was driving on the freeway , less than ten minutes from home when the vehicle shut down. Smoke entered the cab and fire was seen coming from the engine compartment under the hood . I coasted the car past an off ramp and started to exit the vehicle. IT WAS VERY DANGEROUS MOVING THE CAR OUT OF TRAFFIC. I could not see through the windshield and had to roll down my window. The engine seized and the smoke stopped. The car would not restart. I called a tow truck and had the car towed to my home."
"Nov 17","2018","Sorento LX 4.6L Gdi V4","Engine Blown","118,118 miles","My first documented attempt to have my engine replaced due to the sc147 recall was at 96,700 miles or before. The dealer did not fix the problem and my Kia was brought in to the dealership 4-5 after that with my complaints of engine symptoms related to the sc147 recall. Not until approximately 116,000k did my engine completely shut off while I was driving on the highway."
"Dec 24","2018","Sorento LX V6","Engine Blown","113,000 miles","I took my 2014 Sorento in for recall checks on Friday December 21, 2018. I was told there was 3. 2 were part replacements and 1 was the metal check in the engine where they told me they did a ""complimentary"" oil change. They said everything checked out an sent me on my way. We noticed immediately one of the head lights was out, but my husband fixes those no problem, so we didn't pay it any mind. It was Christmas weekend so we didn't do much besides drive a few miles to the store, so the car mostly sat until Christmas Eve. He were headed to see family, not to far maybe 15 miles at most. We noticed the engine making noises that didn't sound great but thought we would at least make it through the day. NOPE! Engine completely friggin died. There we were on the side of the road 3 kids in the car at 10PM on Christmas Eve. Kia has had my car now for 24 hours and I haven't heard a word."
"Dec 05","2017","Sorento LX 2.4L","Engine Blown","56,211 miles","Purchased my wife a 2014 Kia Sorento back in November of 2017 at our local Kia dealership. The SUV looked like new and only had around 50,000 miles on it. I was the second owner and looked like the previous owner took care of the car. Took it home and not three weeks later the engine blows."
"Sep 21","2017","Sorento EX 4W 3.2L V6","Engine Blown","12,400 miles","I have been trying to get a slight miss repaired since the first oil change. Eighteen (18) injectors, 4 new tires (could not balance original tires) later, I took the new service manager for a drive. He agreed there is something wrong with this car. Took it in for scheduled repair (again) on 8/13/17 and on the morning of 8/14/17 when the mechanic started the motor, the parking lot filled with smoke from exhaust. Motor blew in their shop."
"Jan 15","2016","Sorento ES","Engine Blown","40,000 miles","I had all of my receipts from my oil changes. However, I was told by KIA that they would not honor the warranty because one of the oil changed used an after market oil filter instead of a KIA oil filter. My car smoke upon acceleration and has very little power. I was told there is sludge in the engine and I need a new one. I just cannot afford an $8,000 repair. I will never trust KIA again. This was my very first brand new car and I am upside down in payments. I owe more than it is worth. I am stuck and this is so miserable."
"Sep 02","2016","Sorento LX 2.4L 4 cyl","Engine Blown","35,782 miles","Purchased 2014 Kia Sorento in December of 2014. First three service jobs were completed at the dealership. On 9/9, I noticed smoke coming out tail pipe upon acceleration. Husband checked oil, said it was fine but said it needed changing. I knew I was about 2K over recommended oil change. Took to Jiffy Lube to have oil changed on Monday 9/12, when pulling into Jiffy Lube, smoke is billowing out the back of the car. They checked oil said there was no oil. They put oil in it and I went straight to dealership."
"Jul 30","2016","Sorento SXL 3.3L V6 Awd","Engine Blown","59,506 miles","I was driving my vehicle to Amarillo,TX and the trip is about 100 miles from where I live. Shortly after I left home my A/C stopped working and would only blow warm air, I had an appointment the following week to get the 60,000 mile service, so I just added to the things they would have to look at because it was working intermittently prior to that. About 55 miles into the trip while my cruise control was set my vehicle started losing power, there was no warning lights or indicator that there was a problem. I pulled over to the side of the highway and noticed smoke coming out of the hood. I wasn't in a town and it was 95 degrees outside. While on the phone with Kia roadside assistance a state trooper pulled up behind me, roadside assistance told me that it would be 90 minutes to get a tow truck to me and at that time the state trooper told me he could have one there in 20 minutes, so instead of waiting on the side of the road for 90 minutes I let the trooper get a tow for me. The vehicle was towed to the same dealer that I bought it from, this happened on a Saturday, so they couldn't look at it until Monday. Kia did not have a loaner vehicle and since I was stranded and due to the time, I had to rent a vehicle from the airport, which was $300 a week. Monday they called and told me that it would need a new engine and they had to see if Kia would cover it, 5 days later they said they would cover it, but in the meantime I am still having to pay for a rental. My car was towed there on 30 Jul and was not finished until 24 Aug. It is now 7 Sep and I am still waiting on a decision from Kia to reimburse me for the tow and rental expenses. I was told that Kia would reimburse $25 a day if I rent a non Kia vehicle and $35 a day if I rent a Kia, I did not find a rental for less than $50 a day. I live in a small town, the closest rental agency is 30 miles away and there is only one agency in the area, so I'm lucky if they even have a car available, let alone it being a Kia. I have more I can say but I think people can get the picture. I loved my car, but after my experience with how they do business I will never buy a Kia again."
"Apr 29","2016","Sorento","Engine Blown","13,500 miles","Kia has yet to say that they will honor the warranty. My husband changed the oil and they are trying to determine if my husband put some other substance in the car. He has been changing oil for 50 years - I think he knows what he is doing. We are still waiting for an answer but after reading the four other comments about blown engines, I am not too optimistic. They have said it is an $8000.00 repair!!! They have given me a free loaner though."
"Dec 10","2015","Sorento","Engine Blown","30,000 miles","I purchased the Kia Sorento new June 2013. I had my first oil change at the dealer at about 5700 miles on or about November 2013. The dealer told us that Kia had the best warranty and only suggested oil changes at 7500-10,000 mile intervals. I purchased the oil and my father changed the oil 2 more times once in July 2014 and again September 2015. This vehicle was purchased for my wife who gave birth to our son three days after purchasing the vehicle. It was not driven often because she did not return to work until October 2013. As a teacher she only worked until May 2014 and did not return to work until September 2015. She worked less than 10 miles from home therefore our mileage was low. Around December 10, 2015 my wife said the car was â€œacting funnyâ€. I told her to come home and I would have my dad look at it. When she came home the car appeared fine no lights, no warnings, no sounds that wasnâ€™t normal. The next day we were driving and the car it just stopped on the side of the road. We had it towed to the dealership. The dealer took several days to tell us that the engine was blown because we didnâ€™t change the oil enough. We were not due for another oil change for 5000 miles. After a month of waiting Kia told me they were not fixing under warranty. I have spoke to many people, dealerships, junk yards, mechanics... all say after only 30000 on the car no way it should have that much engine sludge to blow the engine even IF it was never changed. (But it was I am not an idiot I know a car needs oil changes this isn't my first car and I wasn't born yesterday!!!!!)"
