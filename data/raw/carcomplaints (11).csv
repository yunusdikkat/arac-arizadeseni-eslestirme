"May 01","2019","Prius 3 4L","Windshield Cracks Easily","28,600 miles","Crack started on passenger side of front windshield. Very strange. I came back from vacation and noticed a large crack after driving it the first day back to work. What I found odd was the crack started at the bottom of the glass, under the passenger windshield wiper. I didn't recall a rock hitting the window while driving the first day back. Really strange that a rock reached under the wiper and caused a break. Anyway, I didn't recall such thing happening. Within a couple two days, the crack spread quickly and covered 1/4 of the windshield."
"May 23","2018","Prius Touring III","Windshield Cracks Easily","42,000 miles","My front windshield cracked last May, 2018 (due to a rock chip). It wasn't resolved (camera/senors, calibration etc...) properly until Aug, 2018. This year, March 2019 the windshield is cracked again, in 2 places. The first (2018) incident I remember thinking (after noticing the crack spread) ""man the rock didn't seem to hit that hard"". The crack begin from the tinted rear mirror area, so I never noticed until it started to spread. I live in TN, urban areas and driving habits hadn't changed, so having two extreme cracks from rocks is unusual."
"May 25","2017","Prius Touring IV","Windshield Cracks Easily","9,884 miles","We bought this car on 2/14/17. It was used and had about 3400 miles on it at the time. In May, we were due for our first 5000 mile maintenance appt. We were on the road, so we stopped by Chuck Hutton Toyota in Memphis, TN, to have the work done. A chip in the windshield had happened a few days before our trip, so we decided to have the chip fixed upon our return. We turned the keys over to the dealership for the maintenance and an hour later, they returned it to us with the long crack across the windshield. You tell me, what about an oil choice would precipitate a crack in our windshield???"
"Dec 20","2018","Prius 3 Touring 1.8L","Windshield Cracks Easily","49,500 miles","Easily cracking windshields from Toyota are not something I expected from this manufacturer. Very disappointed after reading the class action lawsuit that currently in litigation. Toyota should own up to this!"
"Jan 18","2017","Prius","Windshield Cracks Easily","1,553 miles","Windshield cracked.....apparently there was a stone chip at the bottom left corner.. The annoying part is that I would have never noticed said stone chip. It was so small and in the bottom corner.. I had to pay to get this fixed."
"Apr 06","2017","Prius","Windshield Cracks Easily","6,214 miles","Windshield cracked for the second time! It was literally like 3 months after it had cracked the first time and I had had it replaced. Again, Toyota said it was a stone chip that caused my windshield to crack. It was located at the very top of my windshield. I personally was unable to see this stone chip but the lady told me the test they do i that they run a pen down the crack and if the pen catches, then it is a stone chip. Again, I had to pay to have this replaced. Very annoying..."
"Nov 04","2018","Prius","Windshield Cracks Easily","31,000 miles","This is the third time my windshield has cracked and I have only had the car for a little over 2 years!! Again, Toyota says a stone chip was the cause for my windshield cracking. The really annoying part is that the guy tells us that because the stone chip is at the bottom of my windshield, they would not have been able to fill it in because my dashboard is in the way. So yet again, I am being told that I have to pay for a problem that keeps happening and there is nothing I can do to prevent it! Right now, I have not repaired the windshield.....what is the point? It's probably just going to crack again.."
"Oct 01","2018","Prius 1.5L","Windshield Cracks Easily","65,000 miles","I'm a big lover of Toyota. This is my 3rd Toyota Prius. Never had any problems with any of them. I bought this one used, drove about 5k and then a very tiny pebble hit it to start crack about half inch. After that, about 2 inches per day, getting worse. Toyota should recall the part. Thank you."
"Jan 11","2018","Prius Touring","Windshield Cracks Easily","27,680 miles","Small pebble hit the windshield while driving and again, it created a small round chip along with a crack that's deep between the exterior and interior windshield glass. I've had five or six other vehicles that experienced windshield chips w/ cracks in the exterior surface of the glass but this is the first time I've seen cracks that started from a small round chip & caused cracks BETWEEN the windshield glass layers. Once is a fluke, an odd angle hitting at the wrong time maybe. The same phenomena twice makes me think this is a poor design flaw in the property of the windshield glass. I'm not certain cracks between the glass can be fixed and I can't afford to replace the windshield."
"Sep 24","2017","Prius","Windshield Cracks Easily","34,800 miles","I have owned many Toyota cars and actually previously owned a 2005 Prius. I bought the 2016 Prius in January of 2016. The car was sitting in my driveway and Monday morning, there was the first crack that started from the base of the windshield then began to spread at 90 degrees 1/4 of the way up the windshield. While trying to find someone who had a replacement for this car (supposedly on backorder and not available), a second crack started to the right of the first and also has made a 90 degree turn. The dealership states there are no recalls or issues. It is around $400 to replace the windshield, but then was told it was also cost $$$$ to have the side and rear camera functionality recalibrated. My insurance has a $500 deductible and therefore all of this will be out of pocket. I have never ever had this happen to any cars I've ever owned, especially when it is just sitting in a driveway. The dealership mentioned weather changes and or possibly something falling from a tree, but if this is the case, it seems like a super sensitive windshield that would not be very safe should I ever become involved in a crash. I would really love to hear from Toyota or have them replace this to inspect for any possible defects."
"Jun 01","2017","Prius","Windshield Cracks Easily","12,000 miles","A tiny pebble flipped up and hit the left edge of the windshield, starting a crack that slowly advanced rightward across the windshield. I was told there are no after-market windshields for this car and had to pay $900 to replace it. Seemed strange, but now less than three months later, it has happened again. I will be filing a second complaint about this next."
"Aug 24","2017","Prius","Windshield Cracks Easily","17,000 miles","Without any known object striking it my two-month old windshield developed a crack, noted in the morning when I got in my car. I have not been driving on gravel roads."
"Jun 21","2017","Prius","Windshield Cracks Easily","19,250 miles","I bought this car used, drove about 1K, and then a very tiny pebble hit it to start crack about half inch, but after that, about 2 inches per day getting worse. Toyota should recall the part. Thx"
"Aug 08","2017","Prius","Windshield Cracks Easily","6,000 miles","A small rock hit the windshield causing a crack not more than the size of a quarter. Thought we could get it filled in, but then overnight it spread into a long crack across the windshield. I believe the window is too thin and lightweight. Side window had a crack from a rock too. This is too much. Think a design flaw was made here."
"Jun 12","2017","Prius 2 Hybrid","Windshield Cracks Easily","9,400 miles","Our 2016 Prius 2 sedan windshield was struck by a small rock cast laterally across the freeway from several lanes to my right, as one would skip a stone across water, traveling about 55mph. unforeseeable, unavoidable act of chance, kicked up by another car's tire. Initial damage (see photo series) was two unsightly but repairable craters in the outer layer of glass. Within minutes / before an epoxy repair was possible, two cracks grew at an alarming rate. A smaller crack went vertically, and a fast and large crack ran horizontally. Within a day it spanned the entire driverâ€™s side. The crack reflects and refracts light into the driverâ€™s eyes, and is thick enough to obstruct vision even in dim light. Our primary travel is east in the morning and west at night, so the obstruction of vision is an active danger as we are typically oriented on the sun."
"Aug 17","2016","Prius 4D HA Hybrid","Windshield Cracks Easily","5,600 miles","Windshield cracked for the second time. Never heard the rock hit but found the point of impact the next day. Crack was horizontal across 2/3rds of my windshield."
"Apr 28","2016","Prius 4D HA Hybrid","Windshield Cracks Easily","1,250 miles","A Small pebble hit my windsheild, you could barely hear it hit and cracked it. Safelight fixed it."
"Jul 06","2017","Prius 4D HA Hybrid","Windshield Cracks Easily","16,900 miles","My windshield cracked for the fourth time. Never heard the rock hit. I have to replace this glass now with 3 big cracks. I've been afraid to replace it. Glad I didn't after the second crack. I could have put 3 windshields in this car and it only has 16,900 miles. There is a real design flaw in the shape of the glass or toyota made the windshield too thin to save weight for the hybrid. These windshields cost $1300 to buy outright and nobody makes an aftermarket that I can locate."
"Jun 06","2017","Prius 4D HA Hybrid","Windshield Cracks Easily","16,000 miles","Same windshield cracked for a third time. Heard the rock hit this time. I even saw it hit, just a small pebble. I was driving 55mph in the far right lane to avoid traffic."
"Aug 11","2016","Prius","Windshield Cracks Easily","9,500 miles","My windshield is constantly getting hit with pebbles and now have three cracks in the windshield. I afraid to get it replaced because it would be a waste of money with it constantly being hit with pebbles. I don't know if it is a design fault or what is the problem? This is my first Prius and really like the car except for this."
