"Aug 23","2024","Town & Country Limited 3.2L V6","TIPM Failure. Would Not Start","180,000 miles","Replaced the alternator only to have the battery be drained and that was a new battery. The battery was charged and then drove the car down to our church but a lightening bolt remained on the dash and the lights were going haywire. Cm out of the church later and the car would not start. Called my son to jump start my car for me so he. The car ran for 5 min. and quit. Would not start again even after jump starting. Next day had to flat bed to mechanic. Mechanic said was alternator. Update from Sep 25, 2024 My dad looked online and saw a way that we could reset the TIPM. We tried that and the vehicle worked. We used the vehicle for 5 days with out any problems. Now yesterday the vehicle would not start again. On Sunday my husband used the lift gate and also we took our granddaughter to church and she was buckled in the back seat. I am unsure if one of those caused the battery to draw done again. The vehicle worked Monday morning. I drove it for 10 minutes that day; then it set for the rest of the day. I know that it takes awhile for the battery to drain so I believe that is why it did not start yesterday. My son said I should undo the negative cable every night and re-connect in the morning. I do not believe I should have to do that, I have filed several complaints with Chrysler to no avail. Then I see that there was a lawsuit filed against them on this issue. Why were not all the people notified, This is the second Town and Country I have owned. The first one I had I never had a problem with that is why i bought another one. I do not believe I will purchase another one not after all the headaches with this one. These past few months alone I have spent over 2500.00 on this vehicle. If the interest was not so high I would have found a different vehicle by now. One that I could afford payments on."
"Feb 03","2024","Town & Country Touring 3.2L","TIPM Failure. Would Not Start","157,000 miles","I have had issues with the van not wanting to start and the fuel pump continuing to run even though the van would be turned off and the key removed from the vehicle. I would try to start it again and the battery would be dead. Now my van will not start or move or jump, nothing has worked. We already did the bypass at some point in time, probably years ago before we knew it was the TIPM. I have contacted Chrysler and they pretty much told me to kick rocks. The recall is for every vehicle made during that time spend except the town and country. Now I am stuck with this van no extra car, no way to get to work and Chrysler could careless that they sold a vehicle that was not going to last. Chrysler told me my car was to old, but upon doing some research... most of the time the company denies service recalls if the car is 15 yrs or older, well mines not there yet and the company doesn't care."
"Jan 01","2023","Town & Country","TIPM Failure. Would Not Start","150,000 miles","Car won't start. Turn the key and there is a 1/2 second starter engagement and then nothing. It will not start. Battery is strong, new and oversized due to chat room advice. The car still intermittently will not start. TIPM relays are faulty. Dealer and repair shops want $800 to $1200 to replace and reprogram the TIPM."
"Mar 15","2019","Town & Country LX 3.6L","TIPM Failure. Would Not Start","113,000 miles","The whole fuse box is garbage - 4 years ago I have to paid 500 dollars to bypass the fuel pump relay. Now the dash illuminates like a Christmas tree, the windows will roll down on it, and the door will open on it. You can be in the road and shows battery is dying and the wipers will go on as wells as the dash light the radio will go off. You can stop at the mall and lock the car when you came out is wide open with the Windows down. It's a mess. Is been like that for a while - first was the fuel pump. A recall was open for the same part on a Jeep on the same year but no for Chrysler. And it's been getting worse little by little."
"Dec 18","2019","Town & Country Touring 3.6L V6 Pentastar","TIPM Failure. Would Not Start","114,000 miles","Wife parked the car in the garage and noticed an electrical whirring sound coming from the rear of the car after it was turned off. It was dead in the morning. I was able to jump start it and drive it around but even with a restored battery it would not start without a jumper cables AND help from some starter fluid. Mechanic diagnosed the bad TIPM and replaced it. Part cost was over $1200 from dealership plus diagnostics and probably one hour of installation time, for a total of almost $1,500."
"Sep 21","2020","Town & Country","TIPM Failure. Would Not Start","116,620 miles","My TIPM had to be replaced at Suburban Chrysler Dodge Jeep Ram of Garden City, Michigan. First I brought my 2011 Town and Country to my normal place we take our cars. They replaced a cam sensor for $180, which wasnâ€™t the problem so they told us to take it to the dealership. My van would turn over and turn over but wouldnâ€™t start. Iâ€™ve heard of the recall for the TIPM on Dodge Durangoâ€˜s and Jeep Cherokee. My question is why isnâ€™t the recall for the 2011 Town and Country which many people are having the same issue. I believe this should be a recall part so Chrysler do the right thing and call recalls for the tipm before it causes any damage or death. You know itâ€™s a problem so do the right thing. FIX THE TIPM PROBLEM!!!!"
"Jun 08","2021","Town & Country Touring 3.6L 6cy","TIPM Failure. Would Not Start","118,000 miles","My car stalled out and died when i was at a stoplight yesterday.It constantly had the doors opening and closing, and the alarm going off all hours of the night. It never wants to start and sputters and sputters. We've had the issue since we got it 4 years ago."
"Jan 26","2021","Town & Country Touring 3.6L V6","TIPM Failure. Would Not Start","137,414 miles","Failure of TIPM. The inner relay for fuel pump works intermittently or not at all. The car will not start. This failure of the TIPM has also resulted in damage to the fuel pump and has rendered it broken."
"Dec 29","2020","Town & Country Touring-L 3.2L V6","TIPM Failure. Would Not Start","99,891 miles","Hello Minivan Team, This is the second time it happened to me. First was on 8-26-17, when I had to spend a crazy amount of money to replace the Alternator and came back to the road. Now on 12-29-20, the same issue and the same crazy amount of money $1707.51. This... it's just not right."
"May 02","2020","Town & Country V6","TIPM Failure. Would Not Start","125,000 miles","This is the second time and irs only been 50,000 miles since I got the car. Why canâ€™t Chrysler make a decent part? I want restitution!"
"Oct 28","2017","Town & Country","TIPM Failure. Would Not Start","100,000 miles","Chrysler really needs to step up and take care of this TIPM issue. My van is so nice and it is terrible to think that this one thing has caused so many issues."
"Aug 11","2019","Town & Country V6","TIPM Failure. Would Not Start","93,500 miles","TIPM failure resulted in being stuck an extra night near Ottawa, ON Canada, while on vacation from Cincinnati. Cost an extra night of hotel plus towing plus an hour of diagnostic testing by Canadian Tire. Testing verified alternator, starter, battery all in great condition, and symptoms exactly match defective TIPM, particularly a fuel relay defect. Car stalled while driving away from Canadian Tire. Car continued to fail to start on first attempt under any condition. Found it has been possible to start on 3rd attempt, only if transmission is in Neutral. Extremely stressful to be about 850 miles from home and across an international border with a car that can't be relied on. Tried calling numerous Chrysler/Dodge/Jeep dealers as well as independent repair shops, none had availability to even attempt to replace the TIPM within 10 days. Was advised TIPM can't be DIY replaced either due to need for programming. Chrysler should DEFINITELY have an ""emergency"" classification that lets people who are stranded far from home get urgent priority for this repair!!"
"Dec 15","2015","Town & Country Limited-L 3.6L 6v","TIPM Failure. Would Not Start","80,000 miles","Bought my 2011 Chrysler T&C in June 0f 2014. We are the 2nd owners of the van, it had approx. 60,000miles when we bought it, we purchased an extended warranty at purchase. I am the primary driver of the van, about Aug. 2015 we started to have issues with the van having intermittent electrical issues. We had the battery replaced & the alternator was tested; it tested good. The problems seemed to have resolved themselves. Then it started having intermitten issues again at the end of Oct. beg. Nov.; the biggest of these intermitten issues(both times was not starting). We took it to have the code(s) read to see if it was throwing a code. However, the checks always came back the same, ""No codes"". Then as the problem progressed the van stalled on me in the middle of a 45mph road, as I was stopped at a red light with my kids in the car. Then a few days to a week later it stalled on me in my neighborhood going 10mph, I was barely able to coast it to the side of the road & eventually get it to restart. About a week later it went from every few days to a week or so of going out to take my kids to school & not being able to start my van, to it being an everyday issue & being harder & harder to get it to start or stay started once it would finally start. We took it to our dealership, about 12/5/15 to leave it there until they repaired the van. At that point I did not feel that my van was safe for daily commuting. The dealership proceeded to tell me that it was my fuel pump, I kindly disagreed & told them that it was the TIPM but they could go ahead & replace the fuel pump but they were going to ensure that my van was 100% fixed & safe before they gave it back to me. They called a few days later & informed me that it was indeed the TIPM & they would need to order a new one. It was replaced & reprogrammed on 12/15/15.I actually purchased the Van in August of 2014, not June."
"Jan 28","2019","Town & Country Limited 3.6L V6","TIPM Failure. Would Not Start","100,201 miles","Van had been starting under the remote start, rather than with the push button. Codes had been indicating Camshaft position sensors (Bank 2 and Bank 2) both replaced, and misfires in Cylinder 6, replaced both coil and plug, Tire pressure sensors were also intermittent. Finally today it total  the bed and after towing it to the dealer was told TIPM replacement was needed, given what I have learned of this, all the previous issues may related directly to this part and its $1500.00 price tag. Given that Chrysler has already admitted this is a problem in there SUV's why is this not a covered repair for my $40,000 minivan?"
"Oct 04","2018","Town & Country Touring 3.6L","TIPM Failure. Would Not Start","124,000 miles","Wife called and said the van would not start one morning it would crank but not start, had her take my truck that day. Got home from work and it started right up for me. I drove it to work for the next week no problems. She drove it to work for a couple of days then it didn't start AGAIN??? I looked up common crank but no start problems and found info in the TIPM issues Great. I did the fuel pump relay bypass on it and that worked great until November when it got cold. It would start fine in the garage but when sitting outside at her work she would have to try 4 to 5 times to start same crank but no start. Now its sitting in the garage waiting for the oil filter housing part because of an oil leak."
"Jun 01","2015","Town & Country LX V6","TIPM Failure. Would Not Start","47,000 miles","I have a 2011 Chrysler Town and Country minivan. It started have electrical power problems at only 45k miles. The air and lights would randomly come on and off. Than my van battery would be dead. I took it in to test the battery and autozone and mechanic stated that the alternator and battery were good.I took it into the dealer because my automatic doors would not open, it was as if they were stuck. I told them I believed it was a overall computer/power issue. They sent me away saying the sliding door motors needed to be replaced each costing thousands of dollars. I didnt replace them and felt like it was not the overall problem. It feels like there are multiple problems going on all at the same time or same day just different times. Battery completely dead. screeching belts, car acting like it wont start than does after about 7 minutes of trying. Key fob not working or being able to start the car. I replace batteries in key fob, didn't help. Mechanic said it was probably a van computer issue or fuses. I replaced the battery and all the fuses, as well as the belts and pulleys and battery connections.I am so frustrated. I see that my make and model or vehicle has had many of these complaints and same problems. I do not want to open a lawsuit but I am a single mom going through domestic violence/child abuse case with my ex and do not have the money to get a new vehicle."
"Sep 03","2018","Town & Country","TIPM Failure. Would Not Start","115,000 miles","This issue started in 2015 with electrical issues only involving the battery. We had it in shop a few times, each time they fix things but not the actual problem. These were annoying issues but wouldn't keep us down for too long. This current issue which is now just dangerous and ridiculous has been going on for over a year. I began coming back to the car only to find windows rolling down or doors or back hatch opened wide. So now I can no longer run several errands at a time, because I can not leave anything valuable in the vehicle in case the doors decide to open. Also, while driving, the dash board, the radio, the air conditioner, all things electrically ran will just shut down. Nothing turns back on nor can I accelerate the vehicle until it clicks back on seconds to minutes later.I have 4 children and we both work full time jobs. We have a very busy household and this is very disappointing that a van which is known for being a reliable family vehicle has given this many headaches. Its clearly not a wear and tare and it should have been recalled through out the Chrysler brand."
"Aug 28","2018","Town & Country","TIPM Failure. Would Not Start","106,000 miles","On August 28, 2018, went to start the vehicle after shopping and the van would not start up. Sounded like it wanted to start but wouldn't. It ended up starting up, but the issue with starting became intermittent and a safety and dependability concern. Took the vehicle to a local automotive shop and they recommended taking it to the dealership, they believed it was a module issue, they said fuel filter and fuel pump looked fine. Had vehicle towed to the dealership, probably could've got the vehicle to start up after several tries but wasn't sure what was wrong with it and didn't know if it would just stop while driving. Once vehicle got to the dealership they kept it to diagnose, called us following day and told us they would need to replace the fuel pump at a total cost of $843.They called on Saturday, September 1st to let us know it was ready for pick up, got to the dealership and started the vehicle up and the same problem persisted as to when we dropped it off in the first place. Today, September 4th we received a call from the dealership saying that they placed our original fuel pump back into the vehicle and diagnosed it with a TIPM failure, the cost will increase to $1,111.00. The vehicle is supposed to be completed tomorrow. My main concern is that many Chrysler products have had TIPM issues, why hasn't this been recalled??Other Chrysler products that are 2011's, but not Town and Country's, have been recalled for this issue, why has this petition been denied. I really wish more people would do their due diligence and report these things, it could save many of us this hassle and also save the consumers money....and most importantly, make Chrysler stand behind their product!!"
"Jul 24","2018","Town & Country","TIPM Failure. Would Not Start","65,000 miles","All TIPMs should be replaced. They're all crap. Engine won't start, lights go crazy, batter drains, fuel pump burnout, alternator burn out, engine dies... This van is an accident waiting to happen."
"Aug 19","2018","Town & Country","TIPM Failure. Would Not Start","70,000 miles","We were without a vehicle for 3 weeks while techs tried to solve this problem. First they told us it was the engine, so we had that replaced and it still had the same no start issue. Then they told us it was a crankshaft sensor so we had that replaced and still had the same issue. Finally they figured out it was a faulty fuel relay and our van was good. We spent over $5,000 resolving this issue and it would have been $1100 more if we had replaced the TIPM instead of just bypassing it!"
