"Jul 20","2017","Fiesta","Transmission Failed","39,234 miles","Since 2011, there have been numerous issues. The vehicle has not reached 40,000 miles because there is always something wrong with it. As of now, there is transmission failure, jerking, shuddering, electrical problems, and steering problems. Also, the engine dies while driving. I want to get rid of it, but CarMax told the vehicle is worthless in its condition. This car has been a nightmare."
"Mar 18","2017","Fiesta","Transmission Failed","50,013 miles","I have had this car for just over a year, but have only driven it for 21 days. The car currently is at Ford dealership where they replaced transmission clutch and transmission modulator and other minor things. They called me to come get my car, it was fixed. So I drive there, pay a repair bill and get my key..however I didn't make it off the lot when I heard horrible grinding noises. I took key right back inside and told them this is not fixed, something is not right..keep in mind I never left the lot with my car. They had my car for another 3 months then finally call and tell me, oh your car needs a whole new transmission....another 3000$!!! This year, make and model car has an extended warranty for 100,000 miles....this car only has 50,000 on it....they are telling me warranty won't cover new transmission. Who can I contact, where do I turn? This is unjust and unfair.."
"Jan 06","2017","Fiesta","Transmission Failed","37,000 miles","I will NEVER be purchasing a Ford vehicle or item ever again. I received the absolute WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE when I called them and explained that my 2011 Ford Fiesta with 37K miles on it was in the shop for the SECOND TIME for a transmission issue and needed a new transmission and requested that they assist, they said that I am 3 months out of warranty and that they couldn't help me. They sold me a  PRODUCT, they KNOW has TRANSMISSION ISSUES. Take responsibility for your LEMON OF A CAR and give me the customer Service that I deserve. I have called MULTIPLE TIMES asking for a call back, and no one responds to me. I am not afraid to take this to court and will keep reaching out until this is resolved"
"Oct 20","2016","Fiesta","Transmission Failed","106,000 miles","I was reading a comment posted by another 2011 ford fiesta owner with a similar problem and after reading their comment I agree. I have always had a quality vehicle Navigator, Mustang, F150, and an old f100 but this vehicle has killed all fords for me. I have had the throttle body replaced around 30k, the alternator around 40k, the fan actually caught on fire at the dealership while diagnosing my a/c and it took them 2 weeks to fix that, then from 55-100k the vehicle did not have ANY issues which I was happy with. Then in October my transmission goes out....I paid to have it pulled by AAMCO and there is a seal on the interior of the shift linkage that was busted and I had the slave cylinder, throw out bearing(part of the slave cylinder) and clutch kit replaced. After this was completed the vehicle still doesn't go into gear and I'm now in need of a rebuild because the synchronizers are needing replacement. This is the last Ford that my family or I will ever purchase."
"Mar 14","2015","Fiesta SE 4 cyl,"Transmission Failed","42,000 miles","We bought this Fiesta in February 2015. We have had so many problems since then. I strongly believe that the dealership knew of the problem that the car had before selling it to us. When we go to drive it there is grinding from 1st to 2nd. As well as it grinding from 2nd to 3rd sometimes. We have very little to no power in the transmission at all. The recalls that came out on the car not long after we bought it, have never been performed by the dealership. They had told us ""We will call you when we get the parts in, but the car will not drive any differently"" Well obviously that is not true. This is my fiance's daily driver and we are so troubled about this. If this transmission goes out we are totally screwed. We can barely afford the payment let alone a new transmission. Please someone help us to find a way to get this crooked dealership to honor the recall and warranty, it was still under warranty when we first brought it to their attention. We are just trying to get along in this world with 3 kids and without this car we are screwed. We do not deserve to be taken for a run around!!!"
"Nov 05","2016","Fiesta SES","Transmission Failed","100,000 miles","After having the car for two years, the car just simply quit and is not covered at all since it is a transmission issue for a 2011 Ford Fiesta that has just reached 100000km. I had to replace the transmission at my expense. They would not give me a car a courtesy car, they would not even offer to have the shuttle drive me to work. I had to walk the 2km from the bus stop when the location was a five minute drive from the dealership.They would not guarantee the work even though they know that this car has transmission problems and it may have to be done again and again. Consumers of Ford produces are bleed dry when Ford is fully aware that they are offering the public a faulty product. A product which will one day cause someone to loose their life driving something that jerks, coasts, and delays shifting. Ford advertises the product as a automatic when what is repeatedly requiring replacement is a clutch.In the 35 years that I have driven cars I have never had to replace a clutch in any other automatic car. I can't empathize enough if you want a reliable car do not purchase a Ford or you as a consumer will be bleed financially for a product that they are not pulling or recalling until someone dies because of their mistake. And that my friends is a sad day for both Canadian and US consumers who purchase a Ford product."
"Dec 26","2013","Fiesta","Transmission Failed","114,905 miles","This was a huge safety concern especially on the freeway. The car was brought in 12/26/13 and was not ready until 1/15/14."
"Aug 15","2012","Fiesta SE 4","Transmission Failed","5,672 miles","In Winnipeg, entering off ramp, driving too close to the truck in front of me. Truck suddenly hits brakes and so do I. Truck moves ahead and I step on the gas, nothing happens. Put car in reverse, nothing happens. Put car in Park, can't turn off ignition. Cars behind me blowing their horns, drivers pretty angry. I discover that if you hit the brake and put transmission in Park you can shut off engine and then restart.Car then will move forward when put in Drive. A very scary situation."
"Jan 08","2016","Fiesta SE 4","Transmission Failed","127,047 miles","I purchased this car in good faith from Ford, knowing that that I drive 100 miles daily. I need reliable transportation. I have had the clutch and TCM replace a couple of times This part has failed yet again. Ford is aware that this is a design flaw; they extended the warranty to 120,000 miles. Now since my car is out to warranty and since there is a recall on the part needed; I am SOL. I still owe $10,000 on this car. Since I have put over 120,000 miles on the car all repairs are on me; okay fine whatever.Since the part is being re-tooled I have to wait for a repair ; I have been told it could take six months to a year or longer. So in the mean time I still have a car payment, I still have to pay for the insurance, I get to look at my pretty little green car sitting in my yard every day as I have to rely on other people to get to work, (Not an easy feat being 48 miles from work). I am not very happy with Ford.Other than the transmission issues I have been happy with this car. the gas mileage is great, I have been lucky with it up to this point. Ford gave me a loaner (because it was under warranty) every they needed to repair it."
"Nov 29","2015","Fiesta SE 4","Transmission Failed","61,400 miles","We purchased a 2011 Ford Fiesta in October 2015 from our neighbor, who kept meticulous care and service records on the vehicle. The vehicle was always dealer serviced and had been in for the transmission service bulletins. Within 60 days of owning the vehicle the transmission failed. The car backed out of the garage, and upon shifting to drive it would not go into gear, but the engine would rev. The car starts up just fine, but will not go into any gear.We had the car immediately towed to the local dealer. The dealer replaced the Transmission Control Module, but that did not fix the problem. The dealer now reports we need a new transmission. $6500 + tax. We have been told by both the dealer and Ford corporate that we are 1,400 miles over warranty at 61,400 miles, so there is no financial assistance with the repair. We have talked to a Ford regional service manager in Florida who repeats the same denial of assistance. This is the first Ford we have ever owned. The communication from Ford makes it clear to us that Ford does not stand behind their products. This transmission has had many service bulletins and complaints. Should we even be able to afford the new transmission, what are we to do if that one fails soon after going past the much more limited warranty (fewer years, fewer miles)? We were hopeful that Ford would want to resolve the problem with us, as Ford also has a stake in this issue with regard to product quality and how they treat customers. Unfortunately, theyâ€™ve made it clear we are on our own. We are now very discouraged. If anyone at Ford reads this and can help us, we would love to hear from you."
"Oct 01","2015","Fiesta SES","Transmission Failed","100,000 miles","I've only ever driven Ford: Ford Escort Station wagon, Ford Mustang, Ford Explorer, and now have transmission problems with a four-year old 2011 Ford Fiesta. I had the vehicle at a Ford dealership for a month. They notified us that our vehicle would not be ready for another 2 to 3 weeks because they were still waiting for a manual transmission availability. Seven weeks without a vehicle? Really? The communication initiation had been on our part since drop-off. At every contact, we were given the run around. Four weeks into the wait, we decided to not go through with the $3500 work. We were not sold quality this time, and the whole service process had been nothing but disappointing. At one point in time, Ford exemplified stellar service, and quality, however, I guarantee to NEVER buy Ford or it's other affiliates again! And you can be assured that I will express these same sentiments to all who will listen!"
"Jul 17","2015","Fiesta SES","Transmission Failed","60,000 miles","Got my 2011 Ford Fiesta SES Hatchback used in February 2013. It was a tough choice between the Honda Fit and the Fiesta, but I went with the Fiesta. God, I wish I hadn't.In June, I couldn't turn on the air at all without the car making an extremely loud whirring sound. Turns out it needed some kind of converter replaced. $600. Got my car back a week later, and on the way home from the mechanic, the car would only blow hot air. Drove it right back.Another week went by, and I finally got it back. A couple of days after that, I was pulling out of a parking lot and was sitting at a light, ready to turn left, when the rpm shot up and down several times (while my foot was on the break), the car began to shake mildly, and then the rpm finally shot down to 0. The car lost all power except for the battery. I put the car in park, shut it off, and restarted it and it turned back on."
"Feb 10","2015","Fiesta Powershift 1.6L","Transmission Failed","68,500 miles","My transmission went out. Almost no warning, it just wouldn't shift right, so I took it to the transmission specialists to find out what was wrong. When they hooked it up to the computer, they said that first, third and fifth gears were not engaging and it was starting in 2nd, shifting to 4th and then 6th gear. Reverse was still working, thankfully! However, to get it fixed, the biggest problem was that since this was such a new (relatively) vehicle, Ford is not making/selling the parts to fix it. The transmission guy said he could fix it for around $2000 IF the parts were available. But since they are not available, his only alternative was to replace the transmission. Parts (wholesale prices) would be $3900 for the new transmission (which would only be guaranteed to work 3 years) plus labor to install it for a total of $4800. I just checked and Ford is still not selling the parts, so I guess I'll have to sell it for what I can get out of it. I can't see spending another $5K to have it do this again in 3 years! I drove it around town for another 45 days or so and then another gear went out. Now it won't go above 30 miles per hour unless I'm on a downward incline. I might get it up to 38 or 40 mph, but I can't sustain that speed on level ground. I guess I lost 4th/6th gears. Anyone wanna buy this? I was gonna wait until the ""recall"" came out and Ford fixed it for free, but I'm giving up on that. lol"
"Feb 21","2015","Fiesta Powershift 1.6L","Transmission Failed","46,603 miles","Transmission chugged going from 1st to 2nd then again from 4th to 5th. Dealership said to wait till I broke down on the side of the road and they would come pick me up! So nice when you pay for that extra warranty! Then told me it wasn't a common problem. Took it to another dealership, they said it was so common the part was on back order. Turns out they put a band aid on a bigger problem. Less then 3 months later car is back for complete failure. Engine revs to 5000 rpm the second you touch the gas pedal. Now dealership is trying to say its not covered!"
"Apr 08","2013","Fiesta Powershift 1.6L","Transmission Failed","58,000 miles","We were going maybe 35mph when the transmission started making a horrible grinding noise and you couldn't go over 20 mph or it'd sound like it was going to explode. The ford dealership came and got it the next day. Luckily is was still under warranty but barely. I was 2,000 miles from being out of warranty. The ford dealership ordered parts just to find out they were on back order and they had no idea how long it was going to be before they came in. After waiting for two months I finally got my car back but it wasn't because they had received the part that was on back order. Instead they had ordered a brand new transmission and it came in before the parts did. All of this happened not too long after I had taken it up to the dealership telling them it was taking it forever to shift and them telling me everything looked fine. Needless to say, I wasn't a happy camper."
