"Aug 12","2020","Focus","Bad Hesitation/Jerking When Starting From A Stop Position","54,378 miles","It's just getting worse - even when I'm just taking off from a stop light the jerking is getting worse and I've read that's there's a recall on them. What do I need to do so I can get it fixed without me having to pay for it, and where do I need to go?"
"Jul 21","2022","Focus 4 cyl","Bad Hesitation/Jerking When Starting From A Stop Position","79,000 miles","It's really disappointing that Ford let this car just out there - it's an embarrassment to the American car."
"Jan 12","2022","Focus","Bad Hesitation/Jerking When Starting From A Stop Position","81,000 miles","My Ford Focus has been causing problems for me for 6 months now all because of the powershift transmission. I have a dual-clutch Bad Hesitation/Jerking When Starting From A Stop Position that has been shuddering whenever I come out of a stopping position, and it won't reverse at all now, and it just grinds all the time. Taking it to a mechanic couldn't even solve the problem and I'm just tired of Ford and their annoying transmission problems they can't seem to ever fix. Ford needs to figure out their transmission issues because I'm sick and tired of these Ford vehicles."
"Jun 15","2020","Focus SE","Bad Hesitation/Jerking When Starting From A Stop Position","66,000 miles","This is the 4th time this vehicle has been in the shop since purchase in December of 2018. The Focus has had 3 clutch replacements since day 3 of ownership. Probably why Ford dealer certified the car. The reality is Ford should have never resold this vehicle. Ron Norris in Titusville, FL is the dealership. Paid way too much but certified helped the sale, 12K in December, 2018. I still owe $9500.FORD, PLEASE JUST BUY BACK THIS CAR AND I WILL WALK AWAY. I am not asking for anything in return other than a clear bill for a crud car. Anyhoo, today when driving, the check engine light comes on and all power is lost. Engine was still running, RPM runs high, but no power. Not a clutch issue but maybe the whole transmission finally went caput."
"Dec 17","2018","Focus","Bad Hesitation/Jerking When Starting From A Stop Position","101,000 miles","When I purchased the car in August 2016, it was doing it from day 1, but I googled this problem and was convinced that that's how the transmission was supposed to be, and as long as I didn't take off too fast, it would be ok. I purchased the car for my 18 YO daughter who was leaving for college. She drove the car for two years until December 2018, when she returned it me after purchasing her first car. The taking off from a stop is horrible. It's very jerky and almost feels like the car wants to stall out on me."
"Aug 10","2018","Focus","Bad Hesitation/Jerking When Starting From A Stop Position","135,000 miles","I have been having issues with this car for the past year on the transmission. It is known that Ford admits to sending these cars out with bad transmissions and still have not done anything about this problem. I can't even drive my car right now because of this issue, so I am currently paying on a car I cannot drive. Ford needs to recall these cars and do something about this since it is their screw up in the first place. I honestly will not buy another Ford."
"Aug 03","2019","Focus ES 3.2L","Bad Hesitation/Jerking When Starting From A Stop Position","88,919 miles","THIS ISSUE ALONG WITH AN INDICATOR LIGHT SHOWING ""TRANSMISSION FAULT SERVICE NOW"" HAS COME ON. THIS TYPE OF TRANSMISSION SHOULD NOT BE ALLOWED IN VEHICLES. FEELS LIKE YOU'RE DRIVING A MOPED, AS MANY TIMES AS IT SHIFTS GEARS."
"Feb 01","2016","Focus Titanium 2.0L 4 cyl. Ffv","Bad Hesitation/Jerking When Starting From A Stop Position","15,000 miles","Yeah bought my 2014 Ford Focus Titanium hatchback from Gaudin Ford in January of 2016 with roughly 146 miles. Asked the about the hesitation and they told me it's the way the transmission was designed. Worst car ever. Still love my car but ugh the transmission is getting worse lately."
"May 04","2019","Focus SE 2.0L 4 cyl","CVT transmission","61,223 miles","I will never buy a Ford product again!!! My first car was a Ford and I've always had a fondness for Ford cars and trucks. I have owned a few Fords..Explorer, 3 Escapes, 2 Focus', Fiesta. Out of the 7 I think 6 have had transmission issues!! I can't believe that it took me so long to figure it out that these cars are junk!!! I want to support an American made company but unfortunately it seems Ford doesn't care about producing a good solid product that will last, so I'm done no more Fords."
"Oct 05","2015","Focus","Bad Hesitation/Jerking When Starting From A Stop Position","36,000 miles","I bought a 2014 Ford Focus used on 10/05/2015. It is the biggest piece of crap I have ever owned. It was a rental car when purchased from Manly Honda in Santa Rosa. I would like to have the fixed it under the California Lemon Law."
"Jan 01","2019","Focus SE 2.4L","Bad Hesitation/Jerking When Starting From A Stop Position","20,000 miles","WORST CAR I'VE EVER HAD. GRINDS AND SHIFTS DUE TO A DUAL CLUTCH TRANS. IS WHAT THE DEALER SPECIFIED."
"Oct 08","2018","Focus SE 2.0L","Bad Hesitation/Jerking When Starting From A Stop Position","60,000 miles","2014 Ford Focus transmission problem. It hesitates, shudders, surges and jerks when attempting to go from a stop. Why isn't there a recall on this? This is a serious issue. There's is a class action settlement which amounts to basically nothing. I want to sell this vehicle and this is clearly a hindrance. Who will want this vehicle once they drive it? This amounts to a great financial loss. This car is clearly a lemon, being Ford can choose to not recall it and rectify the problem. I don't understand how they determine which issues deem a recall."
"Aug 15","2016","Focus","Bad Hesitation/Jerking When Starting From A Stop Position","12,000 miles","BOUGHT THIS CAR IN AUGUST OF 2016. IN SEPTEMBER 2016 THE SO CALLED DEALER STATED THEY FIXED THE PROBLEM. WOULD NOT PROVIDE ANY PAPERWORK. CAR SHUTTERS, HESITATES, DRIFTS BACKWARDS. IT HESITATES AND JERKS WHEN GOING FROM A STOP TO START."
"Dec 01","2013","Focus SE 2.0L I4","Bad Hesitation/Jerking When Starting From A Stop Position","5,000 miles","Leaky transmission seals that allowed fluid to pass to the clutch, presented jerking and lagging acceleration. Contacted Ford and they rejected my claim for a seal replacement stating my car VIN was unaffected. (Verified by Ford Dealership)Solution: Upgraded to a better brand."
"Aug 10","2018","Focus","Bad Hesitation/Jerking When Starting From A Stop Position","80,000 miles","The blasted thing is worth only 5,000 dollars, and the repair bill is already at 3,000. I am told that this only gets it running again, and may not fix all the issues. This car sucks and I think Ford should buy it back! I have been online and found that transmission issues are a known problem for this particular car, but I can not get any help from a real person with it. All I am getting are robots and having to leave messages, meanwhile, the collections calls on the loan continue. I am stuck in a position where I either have to fix it or let it get repossessed. Please help!!"
"Apr 09","2014","Focus","Bad Hesitation/Jerking When Starting From A Stop Position","5,592 miles","Do not buy a Focus or Fiesta. Both have the same transmission and same issues.I thankfully leased this piece of garbage only for three years in 2014. Even during the test drive I noticed the hesitating. I was assured ""The car will adapt to your driving."" and felt it made sense. I am pretty mechanically savvy when it comes to cars and with it being new, I figured there was a ""break in"" period."
"Mar 05","2018","Focus ES 2.0L","Bad Hesitation/Jerking When Starting From A Stop Position","83,931 miles","This transmission problem started like before, with loss of trans engagement, lack of power and check engine light. This time the dealer won't honor the warranty.... this is a well known problem with the Focus and I complained about it from the first service.Is this problem part of the class action suit against Ford? Do I need a lawyer?"
"May 09","2017","Focus ES 2.0L","Bad Hesitation/Jerking When Starting From A Stop Position","69,060 miles","The problem started like before with lost of transmission engagement while driving, slipping and a transmission fault message the dealer replaced the TCM under warranty but recommend a clutch job of $2000"
"Dec 01","2015","Focus SE 2.0L","Bad Hesitation/Jerking When Starting From A Stop Position","6,835 miles","Took 4 times bringing it in, each time was worse than before. Had the problem for 6 months before they finally fixed it. First two times they said this was normal, third time re-calibrated TCM and the 4th I told them I was leaving it until a new clutch was put in. A week later they had a clutch when originally they said it would be 3 months.What also happened during this 6 month fiasco was the gas mileage kept on getting worse from averaging 7.8 to 9.1 litres per 100 kms. It was good for 6 months and then started to act up a bit and ever since then (now March 2018) it has gotten to the point as to where it was the 3rd time I brought it in the first time. It is worse when it is driven for a while and it usually is my wife who drives with me a bit on the weekend. Two weekends ago I drove the Focus for approximately 100 kms and as the day went on (shopping at different malls) the shuttering got worse to the point when we left a corner it would shutter convulsively for 50 yards or more. My wife tells me this so I get to see first hand what she is talking about."
"Dec 22","2017","Focus SE V4","Bad Hesitation/Jerking When Starting From A Stop Position","30,000 miles","was on recall list when i bought the car in 2016. had to wait a couple months for part to get fixed. was ""fixed"" jan 2017 now problem has come back as of late 2017 less than a year after being fixed. had it checked last oil change in July 2017 beach ford service didnt feel anything. 2/3/18 had my car in for oil change let them know the shuddering acceleration is back. They said would have to schedule an appointment during the week mon - fri 8am - 5pm for their tech to diagnose but i would probably be charged for the diagnostic test."
