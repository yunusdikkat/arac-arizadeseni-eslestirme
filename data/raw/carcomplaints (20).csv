"Feb 22","2017","Passat GLS 1.8L","Oil Sludge Resulting In Engine Failure","105,000 miles","My car was driving perfect, no problems at all. Then all of a suden my car starts making this weird noise, then its dead? My car was in great condition, cosmetically and mechanically. Beautiful car, my first vw and i love it. I just hate i only had it for a year befor it died, my friends have cars that are a piece of garbage but they outlasted my solid car. Then i looked online and found out why, i want justice! My car is beautiful, i just became a lifelong member of vw. I hope they stand behind their work!"
"Mar 20","2013","Passat","Oil Sludge Resulting In Engine Failure","124,000 miles","I ONLY HAD THIS CAR FOR 3 MONTHS AND THE CAR SHUT DOWN ON ME, VERY DISAPPOINTED. MY SON BOUGHT THIS CAR FOR ME FOR MY BIRTHDAY! HE WANTED ME TO HAVE A SAFE VEHICLE TO DRIVE, ESPECIALLY IN THE WINTER. SO AS I WAS DRIVING FROM TOWN WHICH IS 20 MILES AWAY THE CAR ALL OF A SUDDEN SHUT DOWN ON ME. IT WAS COLD OUT AND VERY EMBARRASSING. I HAD TO CALL MY BROTHER AND HAVE HIM COME GET ME AND TOW THE CAR HOME. I HAD HALBINSAL IN ESCANABA, MI LOOK AT IT. THEY SAID IT NEEDS A NEW ENGINE,THE TIMING BELT BROKE AND IT WILL COST ABOUT $4000 TO FIX IT. I WAS DEVASTATED BECAUSE I DON'T HAVE THAT KIND OF MONEY TO FIX IT!!!!"
"Jan 01","2010","Passat 1.8L T","Oil Sludge Resulting In Engine Failure","120,000 miles","O-rings leaking oil into cylinders.Thousands of dollars of repairs to fixCheck engine codes persistentCatalytic converter full of burnt oilO2 sensor trips check engine codes as a result of oil through exhaustThereby won't pass inspection without replacement of cat.converter and sensor, not a fix though."
"Dec 24","2012","Passat GLS 1.8L T","Oil Sludge Resulting In Engine Failure","108,000 miles","I bought my 2002 passat in 2009. I have had Warranty until 2012. I always got a synthetic oil changes at factory recommended time/miles."
"Aug 01","2012","Passat Highline 1.8t","Oil Sludge Resulting In Engine Failure","104,390 miles","I had an oil service on the card just a few months before. No mention as to oil sludge in system, still they refused to fix the problem on their account. Engine shut down to safe mode and was not drivable when it stopped. They changed a few parts after flushing the entire oil system. Turbo seems to be okay from what they said. Car currently works as it should, although I'm currently unsure if the problem has been removed by changing oil type. All services have been done at the dealership."
"Jan 23","2013","Passat GL","Oil Sludge Resulting In Engine Failure","105,000 miles","Engine light came on while driving. Took the car into a mechanic who thought it could be the oil pump. After researching, I came to learn it was oil sludge. On the way have CarMax look at it the engine shut down. Needless to say, my leverage was negatively impacted when it showed up to CarMax on a tow truck. They gave me $1,000 for it."
"Jan 16","2012","Passat 3.2L","Oil Sludge Resulting In Engine Failure","138,000 miles","I bought a VW Passat October 2010. After taking it home I ended up taking it back on that Monday for various problems. They took 90 days to fix my car. My complaint here is that the oil light came on and I took if to get an oil change. The mechanic told me that there was sludge in the engine and that he could not five me a receipt for the change. The motor is running loud and I understand that this my cause me to have to change the oil pump or motor. VW has had several complaints about this problem and they won't do anything about it. It appears to be a design problem."
"Nov 16","2011","Passat 1.8L T","Oil Sludge Resulting In Engine Failure","97,000 miles","I bought this 2002 model VW Passat 1.8T about a year and a half ago with 86,000 miles on it. Event though I had not heard about the sludge problem, I put in synthetic oil a couple of times (last change actually just a week prior to the damage). About a couple of weeks ago, the car started flashing the oil pressure warning at me, but only for a second or so, then returned to normal. Now the oil pressure light is on constantly, and it was diagnosed as having the sludge problem."
"Aug 14","2011","Passat GLS 1.8L Turbo","Oil Sludge Resulting In Engine Failure","94,000 miles","It's 8/15/2011 - I bought a nice 2002 VW w/ 85000 miles on it. After 6 months I put 10k on it and decided to buy something w/ even better gas mileage so I just sold it to a nice young couple that just had a baby (and lived through a recent tornado). The next day the stop engine light came on and the engine seized. They towed it to the dealer and they are saying it's due to sludge and the engine needs to be replaced. It's going to cost $5k. (which they bought the car for $4500 so go figure). I'm up tonight trying to figure out what I'm going do... I hate that it happened and I'm probably just going to give them their money back. But the way I see it VW has a chance to create 2 very happy customers or 2 anti-VW customers. I've read about the lawsuit and if VW would cover at least 1/2 it would be nice.. I would cover the other half and he would still have a great car.. IF not they'll have 2 people that will never buy another VW again. Wish us luck."
"Mar 24","2011","Passat PGS 1.8L Turbo","Oil Sludge Resulting In Engine Failure","113,000 miles","I got this car (2002 Passat 1.8T) from a car dealer, who said he bought it from an auction. I put 1200 miles on it after getting the car, and the car ran fine for a while and then suddenly I saw oil spill wherever I park it. I pulled the oil dipstick put and it has a sludge that looks like white chocolate color viscous fluid all over the dipstick when I pulled it out, I took it to a mechanic after his inspection, he said the history is someone turned the turbo off and there are multiple places where he can see the oil leak. he said its going to cost a lot to repair it so I asked him to take an engine from a salvage yard and just switch it, lets see what he comes up with. Never a Volkswagen again........what a piece of crap I bought, even the VW dealership says the car is a fine buy after looking a it for any faults."
"Oct 13","2009","Passat 1.8L Turbo","Oil Sludge Resulting In Engine Failure","76,000 miles","The car started taking several times to start, and the camshaft position sensor threw an error. We replaced the sensor, but the problem persisted. Eventually we were driving home and the car just shut off. The engine was completely destroyed and we had to replace it."
"Dec 21","2010","Passat 1.8L","Oil Sludge Resulting In Engine Failure","119,484 miles","I do not know anything about cars. I just knew something was wrong. I DROVE the car to the mechanic, and left it. They called me a few days later and said they did some research online and that it was an oil sludge buildup problem that would be easy to fix. Would run about $500. A week later they called and told me the timing belt was broken, and that the oil sludge stopped the cam shaft and froze the lifters. They also said that now the car will not even start and that I need a new engine. They could get me a used one for $2,500 and with $1,500 in labor, I could have the car back for around $4,000. OR that I could give them $300 for what they did do and tow the car home. Now my question is this... From what I've found out, if the timing belt was broken, I would not have been able to drive my car to them in the first place. I'm just so upset and really do not know how to talk to these mechanics and basically need some advice... They intimidate me and I really feel as if they are taking advantage of me."
"Sep 13","2010","Passat 1.8L Turbo","Oil Sludge Resulting In Engine Failure","120,000 miles","bought the 2002 VW Passat Feb 3,2010..bought extended warranty for it..did oil changes and maintained my car with extented warranty expectations. was driving the car and it just STOPPED completley..took it in warranty was denied.. now i read this and the oil sludge has never crossed my mined so i thought previous owners did not maintaine vehical .now by reading all of this complaints i realize its not the previous owners it the whole manufactor who has failed to do the RECALL on the probleme...somebody has to pay to repair our vehicals ...we try to protect ourselfs well in my case with warranty and even at that they fail so now i'm paying a car i can NOT DRIVE ...And still have to carry a note ."
"Aug 28","2010","Passat 1.8L Turbo","Oil Sludge Resulting In Engine Failure","150,000 miles","I am the second owner of this vehicle and have received some recall notices on it, but never anything about sludge engine problems. This is the third time this problem has happened since I have owned my Passat. Nov. 13, 2006, Nov. 24, 2009, Aug. 28, 2010. When will there be a class action suit? VW clearly knows there is a problem and wants brand loyalty. What about customer loyalty and doing the Right thing and fixing the problem so is does not affect our engines!!!"
"May 19","2010","Passat Sedan 1.8t","Oil Sludge Resulting In Engine Failure","108,235 miles","VW passat needs to get in touch those who own a 2002 VW Passat 1.8T, because it is ridiculous what is going on with these cars, this way their market and consumer demand will drop sky rocketing down the hill if nothing will be done to compensate what we as consumers have to go through. If there is any other group that is getting votes together. please let me know, and i wanna be part of it, this is not how business is being done! Supposed to be about consumer satisfaction, is there such a thing anymore, or just to make a sale and see you later. If you are a car maker than you should stand behind your product and make sure what you do will serve the consumer not other way around, where you still end up making money by consumers ordering parts every other day, and this is not the way we can be safe on the road, this will just cause more accidents and others will be in danger! LETS DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT!"
"Jan 05","2009","Passat 1.8L T","Oil Sludge Resulting In Engine Failure","83,000 miles","Let's just call a spade a spade - the 2002 Passat is a piece of  !"
"Jan 20","2010","Passat 1.8L Turbo","Oil Sludge Resulting In Engine Failure","104,000 miles","I had just bought this car and have a $3,500 loan. I now have a car loan for a car I cannot drive. VW should be ashamed to have produced a product like this! I will never by another VW car and will tell everyone who will listen that they should avoid VWs. Let me know if there is a lawsuit. VW should be paying for a new engine because they have known about this problem."
"Mar 21","2010","Passat","Oil Sludge Resulting In Engine Failure","50,000 miles","I bought this car for my daughter in 2002 when she was a sophomore in high school hoping this would take her through college.  I also bought the fidelity insurance policy as well as oil changes.  My daughter took the car to the dealer for the oil changes and the dealership USED REGULAR OIL!!!!  At 50,000 miles the engine had to be replaced.....Neither VW or Fidelity Insurance would bear the cost of repayment.....a few oil changes were not in what they called a timely manner.....whatever....the wrong oil was used and neither the company, dealership, or insurance company would man-up....we still have the car....and always making costly repairs.....what a piece of junk"
"Feb 11","2010","Passat 1.8t","Oil Sludge Resulting In Engine Failure","150,000 miles","Never in all my working of vehicles have I had such a pain in the ass of changing an oil pump. What the Hell???? remove the front bumper? ok. Now pull the entire front assembly away from the body? Ifyou say so. It took some extra steps, but I did finally find the root of the problem to my oil pressure problem. The oil lift tube has a screen in it that had become restricted with the crystalized particles (sludge?) of oil. Poor design only gives approx 2.5 square inches of screen to pass through. Anyway, we removed the pump and lift tube. I went ahead and replaced the pump since I was in there. The lift tube was let soak in carb. cleaning solution, then cleaned. Same was done for the oil pan interior. I saw signs of low oil use in the pan, which I believe was a catalyst to my problem. Bottom line: A little elbo grease and frustration saved me thousands of dollars. Hope this gives some insite to what is being seen in these engines."
"Jan 12","2010","Passat 1.8L","Oil Sludge Resulting In Engine Failure","76,000 miles","Volkswagen is aware of this design problem so they extended the warranty for eight years from date of purchase for those who have proper records of car maintenance history. The problem is oil sludge is building up and destroying oil pump and then engine. Fix is an engine replacement which is more than the current blue book value of car. I am eight years plus 20 days so they will not cover damage to car. I now have a worthless car. I am looking to see about a class action suit. Please contact me if you have any information regarding this. Trish B"
