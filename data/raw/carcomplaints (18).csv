"May 18","2019","Liberty Limited 3.7L","Window Regulator Breaks","68,000 miles","This will be the third window regulator I've had put in the Jeep Liberty. The back windows I hardly ever used, they broke. Now I have a back passenger window propped up with a wedge, and now the driver side door one breaks. I don't know which one to fix first. And it cost around $300."
"Aug 20","2020","Liberty Renegade V6","Window Regulator Breaks","113,000 miles","Apparently, if you buy a Liberty with the original regulator, it's probably going to break."
"May 15","2018","Liberty","Window Regulator Breaks","65,000 miles","Wish I would've know about this website before buying 2006 Jeep Liberty. 3 of my window regulators broke, feel the need to add to the statistics by at least reporting one of them. I was a big fan of Jeep before this car, but this recurring regulator issue has cost me over $1000 dollars to repair and added quite a bit of stress since I have young kids in the back seat. The regulator broke randomly, and the glass keeps dropping in the door...I cannot believe this isn't a recall item!!!"
"Oct 01","2010","Liberty Sport","Window Regulator Breaks","40,000 miles","So Chrysler covered the new motors BUT the new motors did not fit the current glass windows. Had to buy 2 new windows for the fix. The manufacturer should have covered the new windows since they changed the size."
"Mar 01","2017","Liberty Limited Crd","Window Regulator Breaks","157,000 miles","Chrysler needs to pay for repair for the lifetime of the vehicle..."
"Nov 10","2017","Liberty Sport V6","Window Regulator Breaks","79,860 miles","At least the door opens. We just need to get a new regulator to replace this one. After reading about all the issues with OEM parts we may be going with an aftermarket one."
"Nov 02","2015","Liberty Sport V6","Window Regulator Breaks","73,540 miles","In 2015 the rear driver side window regular stopped working. To make matters worse, when it decided to stop working it got caught in the door latch and we cannot open the door, hence the reason it hasn't been fixed yet. My husband will do the repair as he works in a auto body shop it's just him nor any of the guys he works with have figured out how to get the panel off to get the door open to fix it. We are about ready to buy a new door panel and just cut this one apart to get in to fix it."
"May 05","2017","Liberty V6","Window Regulator Breaks","125,000 miles","I understand the 2006 - 2007 Liberty has had recalls for this problem on certain vehicles. I contacted FCA they said mine was not one of them, but to have 2 regulators out on separate windows strongly suggest that FCA missed this one... nice job FCA way to cover up."
"May 13","2013","Liberty","Window Regulator Breaks","130,000 miles","This was the 3rd (or 4th) window that I had to fix. So aggravating!! Why can't this problem be corrected?? My car guy said that the replacement parts were so poorly made that it will just keep breaking. And for me to be prepared to have them tear up again. So aggravating!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"Mar 20","2014","Liberty","Window Regulator Breaks","100,000 miles","NEEDLESS TO SAY AFTER REPLACING A WINDOW REGULATOR FOR THE FORTH TIME ON MY JEEP THAT I LOVE OTHERWISE, I AM SO PISSED THAT JEEP HAS NOT COME UP WITH A SOLUTION FOR THIS PROBLEM. WHAT THE HECK!!!! I WILL NOT RECOMMEND ANYONE BUY A JEEP!!!!!!!"
"May 02","2017","Liberty","Window Regulator Breaks","97,525 miles","This is the second one on the same vehicle. Makes American made stuff not worth looking at. Thanks Cry Slur! You just worry yourself about making sure you can fart through silk shorts while you put out shoddy cheap breakable product. I was a jeep fan, now you have broken the trust."
"Apr 19","2017","Liberty Sport 3.7L V6","Window Regulator Breaks","103,000 miles","Been lucky I guess, mine stays in the garage so it may have taken longer to break. I don't drive it much, maybe 1,000 a year. Went out the other day and the passenger rear window was all the way down inside the door. This happened with the Jeep sitting in the garage all on it's own. Hopefully my extended warranty I bought with the Jeep will take car of it. Have to call Carmax soon and see."
"Feb 12","2014","Liberty Limited 3.7L","Window Regulator Breaks","100,000 miles","The regulator is going out again. I took it to Jeep the first two times and got soaked real well 450.00 the first time and right at 400.00 the second time. Going out again. so I thought I would at least bitch about it. On a fixed income and babying it so I don't have to put out another 400.00."
"Jul 14","2015","Liberty Limited V6","Window Regulator Breaks","130,000 miles","Both rear windows and passenger front broke. Cost $225 at mechanic, about $100 to do it yourself. I would suggest to do it yourself as they will break again. 3rd time I have replaced."
"Sep 30","2014","Liberty Sport Crd","Window Regulator Breaks","93,206 miles","This is the 4 of 4 issues with the window regulators. All 4 have been replaced and will hopefully hold up until I get rid of this piece of crap of a vehicle. Never buying Jeep again and totally turned off of domestics altogether."
"Nov 12","2012","Liberty Sport Crd","Window Regulator Breaks","130,000 miles","This is the 3rd of 4 issues. Yeah, I've had all 4 window regulators replaced."
"Nov 05","2012","Liberty Sport Crd","Window Regulator Breaks","130,000 miles","This is the 2nd of 4 issues. Yeah, I've had all 4 window regulators replaced."
"Jun 01","2010","Liberty Sport Crd","Window Regulator Breaks","120,000 miles","This is the 1st for 4 occurrences. Yes, I've had all 4 window regulators replaced."
"Apr 29","2016","Liberty LTD V6","Window Regulator Breaks","77,919 miles","It was pouring down rain and I was on my way to work...I stopped at Taco Bell drive thru and had to roll down my window to pay....pushed the driver side rear button by mistake and the window would NOT go back up! I had to get out and push it up with both hands...got soaked and had to go to work like that! I was PISSED!"
"Aug 01","2016","Liberty Limited 3.7L","Window Regulator Breaks","136,000 miles","Bought this Liberty and since it was winter, never thought to roll down the back window. Hmm, it would not go down. Took it all apart, ordered a replacement regulator and installed it. Now I find out that I have 3 more windows that are gonna break soon. Nice going, Chrysler!"
