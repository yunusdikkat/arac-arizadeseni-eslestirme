"Jun 01","2016","Corolla CE 1.8L","Engine Uses Excessive Oil","85,600 miles","Engine burnt oil rather quickly. I have to put in at least 3 Qt. of 5W-30 every week (~ 300 Miles - freeway driving)."
"Sep 20","2019","Corolla LE 1.8L","Engine Uses Excessive Oil","188,000 miles","I'd actually take burning 1 qt for every 1,000 miles. Why, do you ask? I have an 02 Corolla that has several mechanical issues that are a pain in the ass. It is currently burning 1 qt for every 150 miles, maybe even 1.5 on a lucky day. I've been told to replace the engine (not only for this reason), but it is also too far gone to be attempting to repair. One of the previous owners kind of neglected the car, let it leak out too much oil and caused some major damage to the engine. I only bought the car for $600, so no, I will not go and cry to Toyota about this since people can't seem to take care of their vehicles."
"Apr 12","2018","Corolla 1.8L","Engine Uses Excessive Oil","148,541 miles","Oil is over 5 dollars a quart. It uses about 2 quarts per thousand miles. 0w/40 wouldn't slow it down. I paid $1800.00 for the car and have had it about a year now. I understand that there are plenty of them still running and using oil. Has there been a recall on these cars? There sure should of been Toyota. It doesn't even smoke."
"Nov 17","2016","Corolla S 1.8L 4 cyl","Engine Uses Excessive Oil","156,000 miles","Bought the car and not even a month later it started to have issues. Every time I came to a stop I was afraid I was gonna get stranded. Ended up replacing the cat, exhaust manifold, both O2 sensors, MAF sensor, Valve cover gasket, Resinator. Just to fix this issue. Car is known for consuming oil. never did it until about 2000 miles ago. I check it once a week and it barely goes down but shouldn't be moving at all."
"May 26","2017","Corolla CE 1.8L L4","Engine Uses Excessive Oil","208,773 miles","Only bought the car for $1100 with nearly 209,000 miles on it. Discovered after buying that it blew blue smoke from the exhaust, hooray it burns oil. For me personally it consumes about 1 quart every 1000 miles with 5W30 grade oil. Also found out the guy I bought it from erased the check engine code before I got it, P0420, meaning that the catalytic converter was bad!"
"Aug 10","2016","Corolla CE 1.8L Inline 4","Engine Uses Excessive Oil","113,000 miles","I started noticing the problem when I checked the engine oil dipstick and it was extremely low. Very unusual since I've personally changed the oil a few weeks back. I didn't think much of it, checked for leaks and checked the exhaust and there were no signs of any oil seeping out. I refilled the oil and drove the car for a few more weeks, then checked the oil level and had the same exact problem, the oil level was halfway down."
"Jan 01","2013","Corolla","Engine Uses Excessive Oil","98,500 miles","Excessive oil usage. Noticed that oil was disappearing from dip stick but not leaking on drive way or on engine or chassis, nor coming out exhaust pipe"
"Jul 11","2015","Corolla CE 1.8L","Engine Uses Excessive Oil","100,000 miles","When my sister bought the car 3 years ago it had hardly any oil in it. When checked out we were told it had a small oil leak, but nothing worth fixing yet. Otherwise, the car seemed to be in great condition. We filled it up with oil and that was that. She didn't check the oil much, but it always seemed to be low on oil."
"Sep 20","2013","Corolla C 4","Engine Uses Excessive Oil","110,000 miles","After reading everyone's post about Toyota Corolla's excessive oil consumption, I'm just sooo pissed off at the fact that Toyota doesn't do anything about this problem. I've done an engine flush with Amsoil. Added Amsoil oil as some of you guys have suggested and within three days my oil stick showed that it was bone dry. ""Bullshit"". We need to all band together and protest against Toyota to do something about this issue."
"Oct 01","2012","Corolla","Engine Uses Excessive Oil","100,000 miles","I went to get an oil change and the attendant said they couldn't do it because there was very little oil. He asked if I had a leak...I said no? From then on the car has been using an excessive amount of oil and the check engine light keeps coming on. Soon after I had an engine flush and the light went off but eventually came back on. I had the code checked & reset and it was a minor problem so I didn't get it fixed but then it did not pass emissions."
"Jan 03","2013","Corolla CE","Engine Uses Excessive Oil","137,000 miles","I love my 2002 Toyota Corolla. I had it for 8 years now, bought it used with 28000 miles on it and it now has 137000. I rave about my car to my co-workers who are having problems with theirs and always brag about how good my car is but that is now over. I religiously do the oil change every 3000miles or every 3 months whichever comes first. I mean I am really good at keeping up with it but twice in a row now, I went for an oil change and the guy tell me that my oil was really really low - both times I wondered why because my oil was not leaking and I don't drive a lot, then around Jan 3 with still 700miles to go before my oil change, my car started rattling like the engine is going to fall off, about a week or 2 before this I noticed that my oil light comes on every time I break for a few seconds then goes away - I didn't think much of it. 2 days after I heard the rattling noise, the noise had gotten worse so I took it in to car shop and here the guy is telling me that my engine oil was bone dry. I don't understand why!! So now I have to keep oil in my garage and maybe refilling it every 1000 miles, this is not good news and I hope Toyota can make this issue go away with the newer models."
"Jun 01","2008","Corolla CE","Engine Uses Excessive Oil","70,215 miles","In June 2008 I heard my engine rattling when coming in the driveway and when I checked my oil level it was almost completely out! I thought I lost the oil cap or oil pan screw but it was the engine burning the oil. Every 1000km I had to add 1 litre to 1.5 litres of 10W-30 oil while the car calls for 5W-30. I started an excel spreadsheet to track my dipstick levels every Sunday morning before I drive to track it. Since my car was just over the 100,000km warranty Toyota wouldn't help unless I could produce every oil change receipt to have partial coverage paid and even then it would have cost me $3000 to fix without the receipts. It's now August 2013 and I'm getting about 800km before adding 1-2 litres of oil as well as Lucas Oil additive to help reduce burning. It's cheaper then the alternative. Other than that the car runs fine. My engine light just came on a week ago but I figure it's the O2 sensor from all the burning oil. To date I would say roughly I have added 106 litres of 10W-30 to the engine between oil changes ever 5000km. Yes, it's annoying to check this each week, but now I have a usage timeline and when I get a new car I will start a new spreadsheet from day 1 that has one page for services at what mileage with invoice numbers and a second page parts I may get like wiper blades, air filters, etc and page three is my oil consumption based on points on the dipstick and mileage recording. If the engine runs fine then you may never have to use page three much, but it helps to have all things recorded when you go to the dealer!!!"
"Feb 10","2011","Corolla S 1.8L","Engine Uses Excessive Oil","100,000 miles","I also own a 2002 Toyota corolla S, I purchased it in December of 2002, there has been no recall on the excessive oil usage problem, how ever there was a service statement released on it. Which means, hey we know this is a big problem but since it won't kill anybody tough crap we aren't going to fix it. But at least you can tell your mechanic what the problem is and they can charge you out the wazoo to replace the engine or the seals in it. I believe when I read the service statement out on it the problem was with the type of seals used. I wish I would have known about the problem which isn't possible since I purchased it when the car was only a year old, I still have to admit that is the only thing that has caused a problem until now, I think my head has a leak in it. but the car has been reliable non the less. Just pissed that they won't fix the known problem with the engine."
"May 01","2010","Corolla","Engine Uses Excessive Oil","58,000 miles","Wish I had known this was a problem before I replaced the first engine because now having the same problem with the replacement! My daughter bought this car new and the engine blew at 58,000 miles (one month out of warranty). We replaced the engine and I got the car from her when she bought a new minivan. Now the car has 20,000 miles on the used replacement engine and uses excessive oil every 300mi or so. I've used only full-synthetic and just holding my breath until this engine blows....scumbags Toyota! It's definitley burning it, have oil smear on the bumper around the tailpipe. Never again will I buy Toyota and will broadcast this everywhere!"
"Jan 02","2007","Corolla 1.8L","Engine Uses Excessive Oil","67,000 miles","I bought my 2002 Toyota Corolla brand new and once it reached 67,000 miles, the oil started burning. Every time I add more oil in the engine, it keeps burning. Right now I am at 170,000 and for every 200 miles, I would add a quart of oil. I must always remember to check it or else the engine may burn out. Is anyone else having the same problem? I'm sure there are people who have the same issue as me. It would be nice to all file a complaint about this issue because it's a major issue."
"Oct 01","2011","Corolla CE 1.8L","Engine Uses Excessive Oil","95,000 miles","This is BS. I google 2002 corolla burning oil and found there are plenty of them out there with this issue. Any class action going on somewhere? I'd love to join. at around 95K car started dipping low on oil. Now it is like 2 quart every oil change."
"May 07","2010","Corolla S","Engine Uses Excessive Oil","136,000 miles","I purchased a 2002 Toyota Corolla S in 2001. Great car & no major maintenance until I hit 90,000 miles. My engine was making a winding/rattling noise upon acceleration which seemed to come & go. I also noticed my oil would disappear between oil changes. The stick was completely dry but no oil light or engine light ever came on. I took it to a Toyota dealership and they did a oil test and had me run it for 500 miles to see how much would be used. There was not really anything gone at that point. They told me the car was getting old and that I should consider either replacing the engine which would cost $3900.00 or I could get a new car. I left there thinking they just want to sell me a new car. I took the car to numerous places & no one could ever tell me where the oil is going but to just keep adding oil so your engine doesn't blow. I have been doing this for the past 2 years now and it is so bad that I only put 3000 or less miles on a 3 month span & I am adding 2 quarts of oil in it. The car now has 139,000 miles on it and as I just turned off the engine as I parked it in the parking lot at work I noticed noises coming from the engine after the car was turned off. I suspect I may go out there after work & something major may have happened. If so, I will call the junk yard since that is what it is at this point. I am very sorry I bought this car. I bought it on the basis that everyone I knew told me I could easily get 250,000 miles on those cars! I will never buy a Toyota again! Toyota won't help anyone. Since I cannot afford a new car I guess I will have to walk to work!!! Thanks Toyota!!!"
"Oct 01","2007","Corolla LE 1zz-Fe","Engine Uses Excessive Oil","93,206 miles","I purchased this 2002 Toyota Corolla new. It started using oil every week and I never had time to check it out and repair it. I thought I am now a statistic for being burned by Toyota with a lemon. It otherwise runs great but I check the gas and fill the oil. I came upon this site by accident looking for answers to the problem. I thought I better add my car to this complaint site, right away. So here's hoping Toyota will pay attention and salvage us as possible bad publicity to their reputation. Thank-you so much for this site and the opportunity to make a legitimate gripe to Toyota."
"Oct 15","2010","Corolla","Engine Uses Excessive Oil","90,000 miles","I bought my Corolla used from a person I knew. I'm certain they took good care of it as I am certain that I take good care of it."
"Mar 10","2012","Corolla LE 1.8L","Engine Uses Excessive Oil","118,000 miles","I have been a toyota owner most of my adult life. I also have a 2005 toyota 4-runner and a 2008 toyota tundra. I have spent a total $84,000 on toyota vehicles and these problems I am reading about with the corollas is really pissing me off. My 2002 corolla is burning excessive oil so I took it to my mechanic. It started using oil probably at 100,000 miles and now it is like a quart every couple hundred miles. My mechanic said it has excessive blow by meaning rings and or pistons are shot. He gave me a price of $3,000.00 for a used motor with 59,000 miles on it. I thought that was crazy especially if this is common problem with the 1.8 liter. I would replace my blown motor with another piece of s++t one. I think we should all get together and bring a lawsuit against toyota and make them recall these engines until all of us are satisfied. I am really considering selling my current toyotas and buying american again."
