"Jan 21","2017","Grand Caravan Mainstreet 3.2L V6","TIPM Faulty, Will Not Start, Hard To Start","98,251 miles","This van has lots of electrical issues. It started with the doors and trunk opening on their own. Then the van would either be hard to start or not start at all. The next day or a couple days later, I'd try to start it and it would suddenly start. Occasionally, it would die while driving. I was able to get the temporary fix of bypassing the fuel pump relay finally and that fixed the starting problem. This is just a patch, not a permanent fix per the guy that sells them. Dodge has recalled other vehicles for but not the Grand Caravans which have the same TIPM. Alternator went out and next the PCM problems started."
"Oct 07","2020","Grand Caravan Crew","TIPM Faulty, Will Not Start, Hard To Start","80,000 miles","The van started having glitches in the windshield wipers, dvd system, head lights going on and off and now its only starts when it wants too! Started doing research and everything is linked to this module! The steering column wiring has been recalled but it's linked to this module. If its an ongoing problem with this year's vehicle they need to recall it and fix it!"
"Oct 09","2019","Grand Caravan Crew 3.5L V6","TIPM Faulty, Will Not Start, Hard To Start","114,000 miles","Very disappointing they know what the problem is and won't fix. Hard to take on a fixed income."
"Dec 08","2018","Grand Caravan Crew 3.6L","TIPM Faulty, Will Not Start, Hard To Start","74,565 miles","TIPMs from 2011 Grand Caravan should have a recall to replace them. How fair is that to the consumer when you know you have a problem with them? If this problem is not addressed soon, I will never buy Chrysler products again."
"Dec 14","2018","Grand Caravan Mainstreet 3.6","TIPM Faulty, Will Not Start, Hard To Start","123,764 miles","This is the first and last Dodge vehicle I will ever own. TIPM went out. At first it didn't want to start. The van would just crank I did not even need to hold the key to start just turned it to start and it would keep cranking until it would start. Then shut off while driving. Very unsafe this should of been a recall after seeing all the other complaints. Replacement TIPM are around $800.00 plus labor. Dodge wants to replace fuel pump first before they will consider a new TIPM. I will buy a replacement TIPM and by pass Dodge installing it myself. Chrysler is lucky I did not have an accident in this van for I would of sued the daylights out of them for selling vehicles that are not safe and a hazard. Chrysler knows there faulty but will not recall them. Worst vehicle I have ever owned. Spends more time and money being repaired than on the road."
"Dec 20","2018","Grand Caravan Mainstreet 3.6L V6","TIPM Faulty, Will Not Start, Hard To Start","78,000 miles","We have had multiple electrical issues with our 2011 Grand Caravan. Many times the car won't start (not even turn over), has difficulty starting, windows and/or doors randomly opening, check engine light, etc. All TIPM-related issues that others have reported. Dodge needs to recall this part because it causes a lot of financial problems for owners while they pay for unnecessary diagnostic testing and part replacements that do nothing to fix it."
"Oct 22","2018","Grand Caravan Crew 3.6L Vvt","TIPM Faulty, Will Not Start, Hard To Start","207,000 miles","Sorry for such a lengthy post, because this will be a long one. I just want to express my regret for buying yet another Dodge. As most of you know, Brian and I own a home in Florida, so we drive back and forth A LOT and we put a ton of miles on a vehicle. BUT, if you've heard of a TIPM, chances are you own a vehicle from Fiat-Chrysler (FCA). Think of it like a command center for all the electrical functions of your car, and in FCA's case a very, very dysfunctional one."
"Apr 01","2018","Grand Caravan Crew 3.4L","TIPM Faulty, Will Not Start, Hard To Start","107,000 miles","TIPM is faulty and have been replaced. Seems like it should have been recalled for the little $$ it actually costs to bypass it."
"Oct 14","2017","Grand Caravan LX","TIPM Faulty, Will Not Start, Hard To Start","60,000 miles","Started a couple months ago that when I tried to start the car, would crank but not turnover. After a few tries it would. Yesterday morning tried to start and it would crank but not turn over. Went online and I am sure this is the problem, the TIPM fuel relay switch."
"Jun 15","2016","Grand Caravan Crew 3.6L","TIPM Faulty, Will Not Start, Hard To Start","98,000 miles","Over a year ago intermittently when you would unlock the doors the horn would start going off and pushing the buttons on the fob after a couple minutes you could get it to stop (pulled fuses). Could not find anyone who had any idea what was causing it. Six months ago the battery started going dead had it checked and the alternator both were fine. Was able to track down that the TIPM had faulty relays that were not shutting down. Now the fuel pump runs non stop (must pull battery cable to keep battery from going dead). The horn relay and fuel pump relays are stuck and can not be replaced separately. From what I see online cost is about $1200 - 1500 to repair. Found a place to send the TIPM in and get it repaired for aprox. $300 and be without till it comes back or buy one off line but then you have to have it reprogramed for your rig."
"Aug 11","2017","Grand Caravan Mainstreet","TIPM Faulty, Will Not Start, Hard To Start","140,000 miles","STARTED WITH CHECK ENGINE LIGHT, TO THE ENGINE HITTING HARD WHEN PUTTING INTO DRIVE FROM REVERSE. THEN TO THE DOORS OPENING AND CLOSING WHEN I PUT VEHICLE IN PARK, THEN TO THE CAR NOT SHUTTING OFF WHEN I REMOVED THE KEY, TO THE CAR STARTING AND THEN DYING RANDOMLY, THEN FINALLY, THE CAR WOULD NOT TURN OVER WHEN I TRIED TO START THE CAR."
"Jun 15","2015","Grand Caravan Crew 3.2L V6","TIPM Faulty, Will Not Start, Hard To Start","45,000 miles","Van started having problems starting, then stalling out and left us stranded several times. Wipers go on and off whenever they chose, rear backup camera stopped working, interior lights and dash lights flash on and off whenever they want as well. Most severe was not starting especially since I still owe $8000 on this vehicle. Found a temporary solution through an internet search and it has saved us so far but it is only a band-aid. If anyone is interested in the temporary fix please email me as I am not certain if I can post the website here or not. The engineer who sells the fix guarantees his bypass. We have used his bypass since July 2015."
"Jun 01","2017","Grand Caravan 3.6L","TIPM Faulty, Will Not Start, Hard To Start","89,102 miles","We recently have been having issues with our van stalling while driving at all speed ranges. This is really concerning me as we most of the time have 3 children in this vehicle as it is used as our family vehicle and when it stalls you lose all control of the power steering and brakes which is really hazardous on the freeway."
"Mar 01","2017","Grand Caravan","TIPM Faulty, Will Not Start, Hard To Start","85,000 miles","I have had problems off/on with my 2011 Dodge Grand Caravan cranking but not starting. The problem is getting worse and worried about the safety of my vehicle as it's our main source of transportation for our two young kids. I do not want to put out thousands I do not have when this issue should be recalled as its all over the internet as being an issue with pending lawsuits."
"Apr 12","2017","Grand Caravan 3.2L V6","TIPM Faulty, Will Not Start, Hard To Start","113,000 miles","My 2011 Dodge Grand Caravan Battery indicator came on, door locks locked and unlocks, transmission goes in and out of gear and then van dies. I put in a new battery and it runs fine until battery discharges so i charge it again and run fine(battery indicator light stay on still). I am told that it's the TIPM."
"Jan 23","2017","Grand Caravan 3.6L","TIPM Faulty, Will Not Start, Hard To Start","113,228 miles","I was having issues with my van starting. At first I thought it was just the weather as it started around Christmas. Then it started having issues all the time. I would have to put it in Neutral to get it to start, and even then it would take several tries throughout the day. I took it to a couple of places to have it looked at, and of course, every time it would start just fine for them. Finally, a friend looked at it and said that he had found online of the TIPM issues."
"Jan 14","2017","Grand Caravan Mainstreet 3.6L","TIPM Faulty, Will Not Start, Hard To Start","99,156 miles","fix it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"Jul 10","2016","Grand Caravan Crew 3.6L","TIPM Faulty, Will Not Start, Hard To Start","99,500 miles","The TIPM No Start issue occurred on our 2011 Dodge Grand Caravan the day after we got back from a road trip (thank the Lord). I researched the problem and found the temporary by-pass solution pretty quick and performed it to get the van to the Dealer. I went ahead and had them fix the problem at the Dealer. The mechanic knew exactly what the issue was and performed the ""outboard relay"" option to fix the issue. I wrote a letter to Dodge Customer Service explaining the issue and referencing the two other recalls on the Grand Cherokee and Durango. I provided my receipt and requested full re-imbursement. The response from Dodge Customer Service was basically â€œsorry for your problem however youâ€™re out of warranty and there is no recall on this issue for your specific vehicleâ€. My next steps are to submit a follow-up letter and CC the Better Business Bureau."
"Oct 14","2016","Grand Caravan 3.2L","TIPM Faulty, Will Not Start, Hard To Start","80,512 miles","if dodge is aware of its failure re the tipm part, then add me to any lawsuit!!"
"Jun 01","2016","Grand Caravan","TIPM Faulty, Will Not Start, Hard To Start","80,000 miles","Out of no where, I had start up problems. It made a click sound, like it was dead. It had battery life to windows, radio, door locks, wipers, etc. it would just click. I researched and saw people had a trick to get it turned on. Turn it to the 1st position three times allowing the lights on the dash to come on, the fourth time turn on the car. It worked for months. One day it no longer worked."
