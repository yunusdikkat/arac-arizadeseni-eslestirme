"Nov 00","2017","CR-V LX V6","Unwanted Acceleration When Braking","60,000 miles","Experience increased acceleration when braking nearly hitting a building."
"Sep 03","2016","CR-V EX 2.4L L4","Unwanted Acceleration When Braking","46,000 miles","Driver was driving in a shopping mall parking lot and pulling into a parking space. As driver was pressing on the brake pedal, driver noticed a burning odor and felt the car start to accelerate. The car continued to accelerate and jumped a curb, proceeded to move across a driving lane, and was headed toward the side of a building. The driver kept foot on the brake and steered the car into the path of a tree in front of the building to avoid hitting the building. The car struck the tree and came to a stop. Still waiting for insurance company to get estimate and have the car repaired. Really don't want to drive the car anymore."
"May 16","2016","CR-V EX 2.5L V4","Unwanted Acceleration When Braking","63,201 miles","I was fully stopped at an intersection. With my foot on the brake, the engine accelerated, the car bucked. At this point I jammed my foot harder on the brake to keep from entering the intersection."
"Aug 23","2015","CR-V ES 2.4L","Unwanted Acceleration When Braking","60,000 miles","When braking for a stop light, the engine accelerated. This has only happened once, however I worry about when this will happen again. Makes my husband and I nervous to say the least."
"Nov 11","2013","CR-V EX","Unwanted Acceleration When Braking","20,000 miles","I was stopped at a stoplight and just as I took my foot of the brake pedal to make a left hand turn my car shot forward like a rocket uncontrollably and I was doing 20 miles an hour if not more without my foot on the gas in less than 25 feet."
"Dec 20","2012","CR-V LX 2.4L","Unwanted Acceleration When Braking","19,653 miles","On my way from work I had an incident of unintended acceleration. I was able to stop my car after about 10 seconds (by switching transmission to Neutral). I brought car to Honda next morning and after two weeks received a letter from Honda Canada stating pedal misapplication or interference with pedal application by unanchored aftermarket floor mat, or both."
"Dec 20","2012","CR-V LX 2.4L","Unwanted Acceleration When Braking","19,653 miles","On my way from work on December 20, 2012 driving 2011 Honda CR-V LX I had an incident of unintended acceleration. I had to swerve to the right and jump a curb with my right wheel off the road in order to avoid a collision. My car was going high speed relative to the traffic. Any attempts to use brakes were unsuccessful and I was able to stop the car after about 10 seconds by switching transmission to Neutral. Fortunately, nobody was injured and no damage to other vehicles was done."
"Apr 22","2013","CR-V EX-L 2.4L V4","Unwanted Acceleration When Braking","20,225 miles","I was trying to park the vehicle in a paking spot in a parking lot of a shopping center. While I was trying to bring the vehicle to a complete stop by pressing the brake pedal, the vehicle kept moving faster and faster until the vehicle hit the brick wall of a building. The air bag deployed. The repair cost of the accedent was about $ 10, 000.00. The incident was reported to Honda through a Honda Dealer, Honda sent a representative who inspected the vehicle for two hours and finally gave the report that there is no problem with the brake system of the vehicle. He also told us in front of the representative from the Dealer that some one from the Honda HQ in CA will be in contact with us. We were never contacted by Honda as of today, June 6, 2013."
"Apr 12","2011","CR-V SE 4","Unwanted Acceleration When Braking","1,000 miles","This was my 4th Honda CrV. Car suddenly, but intermittently, would accelerate upon braking. Naturally, dealer could not duplicate the problem. I feared to drive this hazard and traded it immediately. I would like to buy a new CrV but simply cannot trust Honda. By the way, the CRV I test drove and thought I bought, turned out to be a different car. I checked the vin number on my purchase order and the dealer had substituted an identical new Crv indicating it didn't matter. The one I test drove and thought I purchased was made in Ohio, the one they gave me was made in Japan. I wonder if this hidden defect is associated with production sites? I didn't report this originally to anybody but the dealer. The dealer reported that they had heard about this problem, but hadn't experienced it and could not replicate it with my car. I have periodically monitored this site, and decided to add my complaint, albeit several years later. To this day every time I hit the brakes on my current carI wonder if they will work properly. As an expediency I traded the Crv for another Honda model with the same dealer and lost money in the process, but because it was fast and easy, and to its credit the dealer was accommodating. Nevertheless, I doubt I would ever trust Honda again with the wide variety of quality products out there today. I wonder what happened to the person who bought the very slightly used Crv and whether the dealer disclosed the undiagnosed braking/acceleration problem. Thanks. Ralph"
"Sep 14","2011","CR-V","Unwanted Acceleration When Braking","500 miles","This involuntary acceleration was absolutely frightening. The first of five times I thought I was imagining it the second time I thought my sandal was causing the problem the third time my husband was with me and I could not stop the car when I stepped on the brakes the car accelerated through the stop. I could not believe it! My husband insisted we take the car back to he dealer. They kept the car for a week called in a specialist from Honda of course they could NOT replicate the problem. I think they put a new sensor in. Now the car rev's up to 3 RPM's with no gas and the gas mileage is between 5-10 miles less than before.I don't trust this car anymore. It still has an acceleration problem....Now one year old thinking about another make and model. Looking into it.Read other complaint very accurate description of my experience I know there are more of us out there.Thanks for this forum."
"Sep 06","2012","CR-V ES V4","Unwanted Acceleration When Braking","26,500 miles","We bought a Certified 2011 Honda CRV. We were very happy until my wife experienced this horrible incident. She stopped at the red light behind this 18 wheeler. Then suddenly her car started to move forward. My wife frantically applied brakes without any result. Her car hit the 18 wheeler and continue to push forward. 18 wheeler did not even notice this and took off. She turned ignition off and car rolled to side road. Dealer ran all kinds of testing and test drove the vehicle. Of course, they did not find any issues. They told us that they found the water bottle rolling around driver side floor. I did not bother telling them how the water bottle could have landed on floor while the vehicle was being towed. We are very concerned with this issue. I was hoping to hear that they found something or had a possible solution."
"Jul 22","2012","CR-V","Unwanted Acceleration When Braking","2,600 miles","Bought the car new in October 2011, Had the same problem three times within the first month, brought to dealer who checked it and found nothing. Began to think it was just me (had a Dodge Durango prior to the CRV, which had more widely spaced pedals), and that I might be pressing gas and brake at same time. Was extra careful, and never happened again until yesterday, when the car really took off. Luckily it was into my own garage (much damage, but car seems OK, because initial impact was into rubber garbage can). Now, I'm afraid to drive the car, and don't know what to do, since it already checked out OK with dealer in late 2011. Help!"
"May 31","2012","CR-V","Unwanted Acceleration When Braking","31,200 miles","While at a full stop removed my foot from the brake and the car bucked and accelerated into another car I couldn't get the car to stop."
"Dec 09","2011","CR-V 4 cyl","Unwanted Acceleration When Braking","4,800 miles","On Dec.9, I entered the underground parking lot on the campus of Ohio U. in my 2011 CR-V. After taking the ticket from the machine, I felt the car suddenly accelerate , but it did respond to the brakes. As I turned cautiously to enter the parking spaces area, the engine again revved up, sounding shrill and loud like a jet engine. I wasn't able to stop and bashed into a concrete support pillar. I was wearing my seat belt; the air bag deployed."
"Aug 20","2011","CR-V LX 2.4L","Unwanted Acceleration When Braking","3,300 miles","Last weekend, after coming back from from shopping as usual, I parked my CR-V in front of garage and noticed that the engine kept rev up and roaring though I had place the gear in Neutral (N)...That was the third time I noticed since we bought this CR-V brand new from the dealer...It is so annoying that we would like to get rid off that right away if possible...We have been a Honda fan for so many years, but its quality is getting worse and worse...That was one of the reasons we sold our lovely Odyssey'06 with only 50K for only 15K because the transmission started shaking and slipping...I am planning to bring the car to the dealer this weekend and let them know the problem; hopefully they can diagnose and fix the problem for us until it is too late...Any advice from you folks what we should do would be greatly appreciated!"
"Aug 20","2011","CR-V LX 2.4L","Unwanted Acceleration When Braking","3,300 miles","I bought this CR-V for weekend use purpose...In the last 2 weeks, my wife and I noticed that the engine for some reason rev up though we put our car in P gear, and we were out of the car...we then checked the gas pedal to see it get stuck or not, we did not see anything wrong with it...We then turned off the engine, then restarted it, the problem still exist...We have bought this car for few months, and it had happened twice so far already..."
"Feb 15","2011","CR-V SE V4","Unwanted Acceleration When Braking","1,400 miles","Engine accelerated when tried to stop.It happened again. Tried to stop and car accelerated. This is the 6th time in first 1400 miles of ownership. Took it to Honda and they test drove it and it happened to them. It is verified by Honda after they insisted it was not happening and could not happen. One person in service believed me and if not for him Honda would not have looked at the car again. At one point Honda even sent me a letter saying they have done everything possible and nothinig is wrong. They say they are going to put in a new power contol module (PCM) to fix the problem."
"Mar 08","2011","CR-V SE V4","Unwanted Acceleration When Braking","1,868 miles","Safety issue with unwanted acceleration when braking with new 2011 Honda CRV. Pulled into a parking space. Engine maintained RPMs when braking. Shifted to neutral and RPMs went up to 4700 or more. Honda has duplicated problem so this is real thing. No mats on pedals or foot on gas and brake at same time. The engine really periodically accelerates when I try to stop the car. Has happened multiple times to me and to Honda service when they test drove car."
"Feb 12","2011","CR-V SE V4","Unwanted Acceleration When Braking","1,196 miles","Safet, safety, safety for driver, other cars, and pedestrians. Periodically try to stop at a light or crossing and engine either revs or maintains speed. Must press hard on brake to keep car from moving forward. Must shift to neutral, turn car off, and restart to get rid of problem. Occured multiple times and witnessed by another person in car. Honda keeps saying no codes present, cannot reproduce."
"Jan 29","2011","CR-V SE V4","Unwanted Acceleration When Braking","723 miles","Was going about 40 MPH and applied the brake at a red light and engine maintained its speed did not shift down to idle. I shifted to neutral, per Honda's instruction, and turned the car off. At green light started car again and was ok."
"Dec 15","2022","CR-V LX 1.5L Turbo","Unwanted Acceleration When Braking","77,671 miles","Coolant is being lost from the radiator system. Dealer can't find leak. Seems to be time related rather than hours of operation. Not resolved."
"Nov 01","2019","CR-V Touring","Unwanted Acceleration When Braking","20,300 miles","It's crazy to buy a brand new car in this day and age and have no heat! Like the others, the car has to be running in order to have heat! No such thing as warming up before you get in. And God forbid you have to stop at a long red light, the cold air blows in!!! On short trips, just plan on being cold."
"Nov 29","2019","CR-V EX 1.5t","Unwanted Acceleration When Braking","18,641 miles","Windshield remains fogged up until the car runs for a km, at least. Worst CR-V ever built."
"Oct 19","2022","CR-V","Unwanted Acceleration When Braking","22,000 miles","My warranty ran out in July, so I have to pay $2,000 out of my pocket if I want heat for the winter. The car only has 22,000 miles on it. The problem has to be a manufacturer's defect in the heater."
"Dec 03","2018","CR-V LX 1.5lV4","Unwanted Acceleration When Braking","8,000 miles","The heater is not working properly. It seems fans are not doing as it should. The car door seal is not good. I was told the engine is too small but my old car Toyota had the size of engine and heat the car very well. it is a shame."
"Dec 31","2018","CR-V EX 1.5L","Unwanted Acceleration When Braking","15,000 miles","Just want to say that this my first Honda (my family has had dozens of Hondas and Acuras since the 80s) and it's been a nightmare experience since new. First, my hood paint blistered and rusted when the car was only 9 months old and I have to drive around with a devalued vehicle with an aftermarket painted hood that was replaced under warranty. Anyone who buys this car from me (I can't wait to get rid of it) will think I was in a wreck because the crappy paint job makes it obvious the hood was repainted."
"Nov 25","2020","CR-V","Unwanted Acceleration When Braking","54,617 miles","The heat stops working when the car is idle. I paid $552 for a new thermostat and the problem is still present. Heat is blowing and heating fine when the car is moving but stops blowing warm air when the car is idle."
"Feb 01","2018","CR-V EX 1.5L","Unwanted Acceleration When Braking","12 miles","HEAT not working is a safety issue as if you get stranded in -20 to -50 weather you will freeze to death in this car. It should at least come with candles to keep you warm you would think. I am actively looking for a solution I will update and post the fix if there even is one besides burning candles for heat which is a fire hazard. So if anyone else has a solution please msg me and let me know by leaving a comment under my post. I'm from Calgary, AB Canada"
"Nov 01","2017","CR-V ES","Unwanted Acceleration When Braking","6,214 miles","2017 Honda CR-V.....no heat ever !! You can command start it at least 3 Times then drive for 20 minutes ...still no heat....have complained to dealer and Honda Customer Service all to no Avail. This vehicle should have never been sold In cold climates !! If there is a Class Action law suit, I would definitely join. So disappointed as this is my 4th Honda and will definitely be my last. Still waiting to hear back from Customer Service since March 2020."
"Dec 01","2018","CR-V LX 1.5lV4","Unwanted Acceleration When Braking","5,000 miles","2017 Honda CRV IS SO POOR."
"Nov 05","2018","CR-V EX-L","Unwanted Acceleration When Braking","6,500 miles","Worst car I have ever owned, and I have literally owned at least 20-30 autos. After a long period car will warm somewhat, but as soon as the blower motor comes on the heater gauge drops to zero and blows cold air. When using remote start I never heat up. Blasts cold air. Honda quality control is unacceptable!!"
"Jan 21","2019","CR-V EX-L 1.5L","Unwanted Acceleration When Braking","27,000 miles","The heat does not work properly when it is cold out. Auto start does nothing to warm up the car. The cars temperature gauge only moves towards the center when the car is moving. Once is it half way, a normal car would then produce heat. Not this car! You turn the heat on and the gauge drops all the way down, to nothing! With the heat not working Iâ€™m left with windows that are foggy/icy which limits my visibility creating dangerous driving conditions. Even with driving on the highway for 30 minutes, the inside of the car is freezing, door windows are foggy and will start to have ice form on them and the front and rear windshields fog up and do not fully unfog."
"Sep 01","2018","CR-V EX 1.5L Turbo","Unwanted Acceleration When Braking","18,000 miles","This is our 5th Honda, second CRV. We live in Northern New Hampshire and it gets cold here. The heat has never work correctly. At times no heat even coming out vents. It seems everyone with this vehicle, is having the same problem. It Honda doesn't.correct this problem, I'll never purchase another one. $27,000 and can't even get heat."
"Feb 21","2019","CR-V EX 1.5L","Unwanted Acceleration When Braking","23,000 miles","The heat doesn't work properly. When driving in temps 20 degrees or less (a daily occurrence in WI) the only way the vehicle temp gauge seems to rise is freeway speed driving for 10+ minutes. Upon stopping at a light the temp gauge routinely drops before my eyes. The air temp coming from the vents never seems to get ""hot"". Using the remote start to ""warm up the vehicle"" the car never comes off the ""C"" on the temp gauge. Once the vehicle comes to temp after freeway driving it doesn't hold temp. Once off the freeway the temp gauge starts dropping."
"Dec 05","2018","CR-V EX 1.5L","Unwanted Acceleration When Braking","18,020 miles","I have a 2017 Honda CRV EX and had the recall fix for the oil dilution issue. The climate control module was replaced as part of the recall. However, the car still will not warm up at a normal rate and the temp drops like a stone in idle. The recall fix did not solve the engine heat problem!!! I assume the oil dilution issue may continue as well as it is related to engine temps not being hot enough on short trips."
"Dec 01","2017","CR-V","Unwanted Acceleration When Braking","5,000 miles","Little to no heat in car in winter. Wrote to Honda, who provided me with non-sense suggestions to resolve this such as plug-in heater and drive low gear, etc.... I don't understand that Honda is not addressing this. I just became aware that the main consumer organization in Quebec, Protegez-vous, is no longer recommending this vehicle to consumers because of this issue.... Sad, I have owned Honda vehicles for over 40 years."
"Dec 01","2018","CR-V EX-L 1.5L Turbo","Unwanted Acceleration When Braking","34,000 miles","Car does not warm up properly in cold weather - does not warm up at idle and can take a long time to warm up when driving. Honda does not acknowledge that there is a problem."
"Jan 06","2018","CR-V EX 1.5L L4","Unwanted Acceleration When Braking","700 miles","The technician and advisors said nothing is wrong with the heat, even though it's blowing cold air, which I made them feel with their own hand. Then they ran the engine for 1 hour inside the shop said nothing is wrong. Some jackass advisor told me all cars have low heat when it's cold outside. So I left with nothing being solved."
"Jan 03","2018","CR-V LX 1.5L Turbo","Unwanted Acceleration When Braking","12,427 miles","It is very hard for the 1.5L Turbo engine to reach it's normal temperature. During the winter, if you don't drive the temperature never raise and the cabin temperature stay cold. If there is ice on the windshield you have to remove it with a scraper. Even after 20 minutes at idle there is not heat. If the temperature of the engine raise a little pray not to stop on a red light for a long period because the temperature of the engine start to drop. When you have to drive on heavy traffic this become a nightmare."
"Dec 12","2017","CR-V LX 2.4L","Unwanted Acceleration When Braking","100 miles","Was going about 40 MPH and applied the brake at a red light and engine maintained its speed did not shift down to idle. I shifted to neutral, per Honda's instruction, and turned the car off. At green light started car again and was ok."
