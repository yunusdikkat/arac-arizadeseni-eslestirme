"Jun 01","2023","Wrangler Limited 3.6L V6","Head Has To Be Replaced","87,000 miles","I reach out to Chrysler customer service regarding a check engine light which the code is P0306. They told me that my Jeep Wrangler Jk was out of warranty, and they cannot do anything for me."
"Jul 19","2020","Wrangler Sport 3.6L","Head Has To Be Replaced","138,701 miles","Purchased used on 7/19/20, and it started overheating immediately. Going through coolant like crazy, so I contacted dealer. They were no help, so I called Chrysler, and no help. Found in history report that at 24,275 miles left head was replaced, at 102,314 miles both heads replaced."
"Jul 29","2019","Wrangler Sport 3.6L V6","Head Has To Be Replaced","93,000 miles","Finally bought the car of my dreams, 2012 JKU. I saved up for years and purchased the year with the ""better"" engine. So I thought."
"May 21","2019","Wrangler JK 3.2L V6","Head Has To Be Replaced","40,800 miles","I purchased the Jeep here from Dallas Dodge in October 2012 paying cash. I brought my Jeep in to have the airbag recall completed on 5-21-19. I sat in the waiting area a couple hours on the 21st. The Jeep has 40,800 miles on it. The engine light was on and I was aware it was misfiring."
"Apr 14","2018","Wrangler Rubicon 3.6L V6","Head Has To Be Replaced","91,000 miles","I listen to my car all the time because I have had 3 CJ-7s in my life, a Dodge 3/4 ton Cummins diesel and a BMW 2008 before this Rubicon. I know my vehicles inside and out. And one day after running errands, I heard ticking. I threw in the clutch to see if it was the plate or flywheel but it kept ticking. When I got home, I got out and listened. It doesn't sound like a ticking lifter (like I have had on a CJ before). This wasn't loud yet. I took it to the dealership but it wasn't ticking. I will drive it until it gets louder. I have until 2021 or 150,000 miles to address it. I asked them to check the julian date on the heads. = Not sure if they did but I will do that myself if I have to. I will take it back in when I hear it and try to get them to go ahead and replace the left head that is known for the issue."
"Jul 06","2015","Wrangler 3.6L V6","Head Has To Be Replaced","37,282 miles","After five years, the exact same vehicle is worth 10,000 more Canadian dollars. After regular maintenance and thousands of dollars of charges I think it's time to a buy made in China vehicle, at a China price to eliminate the headaches or at least afford the headaches."
"Jul 22","2016","Wrangler Rubicon Pentastar","Head Has To Be Replaced","55,000 miles","45 days now in the dealership with a blown engine. According to case manager at Chrysler its not uncommon for the ""power train"" dept as she called it, to ask for multiple photos and samples of oil, etc to make sure its not a neglect issue or other, and that can take weeks back and forth with the dealership. I thought was such bs but after all this im semi-happy now that they are giving me a new engine(although not too happy). The initial problem was misfire in cylinder 2. The service rep calls me later after the diagnostic and tells me my engine is blown and has lost compression.WOW! only 55k and its blown? Ok so although that sucks i had some hope as I bought the jeep new with the Lifetime power train warranty and a Mopar added Careplus service warranty. I dont know how that all played out into them getting me a new engine.I did however contact Chrysler alot and was even about to have an attorney who is family (no cost) to write them a letter that we would pursue legal action with a DTPA especially since alot of the dealerships apparantley knew about the issue yet kept the jeeps on the lot instead of doing the right thing and fixing it then and there. Seems like they are selling them to get numbers up and then dealing with the problem later. looks good on paper until the customer comes back and is pissed to find out that its a known issue and also jump through all the hoops to get the repair approvedand WAIT 45 days and more with no loaner no rental for a chrysler derived issue.So im waiting for the engine to get to the dealership still and from there it takes a week, which will likely be more because we all know how that goes.My thing is this, the defective head is a KNOWN problem for Chrysler and anyone experiencing the issue should have it replaced promptly and be put in a rental instead of having to wait over 40 days.Im not too sure how long anyone else has taken but this is my experience.After all it is a manufacturing issue or design flaw or who knows but its not the owners fault.Hope this gave some hope and maybe you can cite this to try and get a new engine also. After all who knows how much damage the defective head caused to the rest of the engine.-Raymond Estrada"
"Jun 21","2016","Wrangler","Head Has To Be Replaced","49,000 miles","I was driving on the FDR in NYC during rush hour when my Jeep Wrangler started to shake violently, then it STALLED in the middle of the FDR ! There was someone behind me. Luckily he wasn't distracted and was able to brake in time and get into another lane. I was very lucky - there could have been a major crash. I was also lucky I did not have a heart attack."
"Feb 18","2016","Wrangler Unlimited 3.6L V6","Head Has To Be Replaced","23,673 miles","I purchased my jeep wrangler in 2012 brand new . My first new vehicle ever. It is a right hand right jeep Gecko Green awesome color . I was so in love. I am a rural route mail carrier in Iowa. It made my job so much easier. WELL at 23,673 miles the engine light came on . I was very concerned so to the dealership we went. AND a new head was going to have to be replaced. # 6, # 2 , # 4 cylinder was misfiring. Code P0306 was found. I entered the dealership on 2/6/13 and did not get mt jeep back until 3/19/13 WOW 51 days later. Then as time went on all of my idiot lights came on, the traction light, engine light several others. My wiring harness needed to be replaced again and again with a total of 4 times. The real reason WHY was never explained to me. I was told once that a mouse got on my engine and chewed on the wire. I said REALLY, I think that the mouse walks on two legs and carries a wrench. I was working six day a week at that time No way in heck that mouse had any time to do that. A LIE . One of many that I am receiving from this dealership . So after many times returning to this dealership that problem was fixed FINALLY!!! So before the jeep reached 100,000 miles I thought I should get a extended warranty on the jeep and Chrysler would not even consider me for any warranty. If I wanted a warranty it was going to cost me around $4,000 to $5,000. I called Chrysler Service Department and got a case number and the battle was on . After weeks of discussion I received 3 warranties, engine, transmission, and electrical, four years unlimited miles. I thought GREAT! So now I have had my jeep for four years I have 148,540 miles now the jeep . I have a head problem again. I get my jeep serviced every 3,000 miles give or take a few. I believe in preventive maintenance and that did not help. So the jeep is back into the dealership again. It has been in there for 8 days now . Went in on 2/12/2106 at 3:30 as of 2/19/2016 a inspector showed up to look at the head but it was not the way he wanted it - to be able to take pictures of it -so I am waiting again . I am now doing a lot of research on this problem. Let me added that before the jeep- I drove a 1989 bronco II for 3 years with over 100,000 when I purchased it and NEVER had a engine issue. Then I purchased a 1996 GMC jimmy with over a 100,000 miles and NEVER had engine problem and drove that until transmision went out at 206,000 miles. Then I purchased a 2000 pretty blue Chevy Blazer with 27,000 miles and still driving it on mail route today at 185,000 and NEVER had the any troubles with the engine. UNBELIEVABLE 16 years !!! ALL of the miles on the blazer are mail route miles. I never had another vehicle drive. SO WHY I am having to replace TWO heads on A 2012 Jeep ???? So if any one out there can explain WHY- to me- PLEASE do. I need some advise on what I should do about this . I am still making a $563.00 a month payment on a very unreliable vehicle. I purchased a brand new vehicle to be dependable and it is not- at all. Down time kills me. At least I fought for a warranty and it is not completely coming out of my pocket. But what I want is a dependable vehicle."
"Aug 01","2015","Wrangler Unlimited 3.2L V6","Head Has To Be Replaced","63,231 miles","MIL has been off/on for under 3 weeks. I've spent >$600 at 2 separate places w/o a fix. Code initially read, thermostat and misfire in coil #4...had both replaced; still MIL indicates misfire in #4 and multiple misfires..get it fixed. MIL now on indicating bad head. WTF! I heard the 2012 JKUs had a recall on the 3.2L V6 for this. True? If not, any legitimate knowledge on estimated cost to repair?"
"Aug 17","2015","Wrangler Rubicon 3.6L V6","Head Has To Be Replaced","27,725 miles","I'm concerned that my dealership is only rebuilding the #2 cylinder (cylinder sleeve, piston rings, etc) as the fix. I'm hoping this is an actual fix and this issue doesn't crop up again later. Most others here report their dealership replaced the entire left head."
"Apr 15","2015","Wrangler Rubicon 3.6L","Head Has To Be Replaced","24,053 miles","Vehicle with less than 25,000 miles should not have an engine problem. Engine light came on, checked the book and it indicated it might be a gas cap problem. However, when taken to check the code, it is a misfire on cylinder #4."
"Jul 09","2014","Wrangler Sport 3.6L V6 Pentastar","Head Has To Be Replaced","19,500 miles","Engine has had a ticking for some time and is progressively getting louder."
"Oct 10","2014","Wrangler Sport Unlimited Pentastar","Head Has To Be Replaced","35,000 miles","2nd time head has to be replaced, we love the car but it is aggravating not having a reliable Jeep."
"Aug 07","2014","Wrangler Unlimited 3.6L","Head Has To Be Replaced","28,325 miles","Full disclosure, this is a rebuilt title so I understand there is no warranty on the vehicle."
"Mar 28","2014","Wrangler Limited V6","Head Has To Be Replaced","39,001 miles","Check engine light came on so I took to dealer and he acted like no big deal. Don't worry it is covered under warranty. We will have it in about a week. Now after almost 2 weeks I am told the head is on back-order. Don't worry it will not cost you anything. Well I am on my second week in a rental car at $175 a week?? Not very good customer service!"
"Aug 01","2013","Wrangler","Head Has To Be Replaced","40,000 miles","The engine light went on. I brought the jeep into the dealer. They ran the car on their diagnostic machine and reset the engine light and told me to pick it up. They didn't do a thing and evaded what was wrong with the car."
"Aug 12","2013","Wrangler Rubicon 4 Door 3.6L V6","Head Has To Be Replaced","18,598 miles","On Monday, August 12, 2013, I drove my 2012 Jeep Rubicon 4D, to get gas. As I arrived, I heard a beep and then saw that my ""engine"" light was on. I then filled up and zipped over to the Jeep dealership, located in Poway, California. Once I parked in ""Service"" (at 3:30) the female service writer would not come out, so I went in and explained that I had gone to get gas and the ""engine"" light came on. She said this may occur due to the gas cap. I then clarified that I had not yet put gas in the vehicle. I was basically asked to return the following day, so I made an appointment. Dropped of the vehicle by 0730 hours. One hour later a different female service writer let me know that a Cylinder Head needed to be replaced. I was told this would take about two days, so I opted to leave it for the repair. I was then provided a ride home, without an offer for a rental."
"Jun 04","2013","Wrangler Rubicon 3.6L","Head Has To Be Replaced","15,000 miles","Bought 2012 Jeep Wrangler Rubicon a month after I had it I heard a ticking on the driverside of the motor at the drive thru.. I had the same problem were the dealer won't fix until a light or warning shows up.. Guess they don't care if your stranded somewhere. After I had taken the two piece part of the top off and it had rained and this thing was like NOAH'S ARK drivers side floor completley soaked and the latches all leaked onto my nav screen. I told the service guy he could keep the napkin I had jammed up there to prevent my nav from getting ruined..I new I should have kept my Nissan Pro 4x.. Had to take in twice for the top leaking and the dealer left my floor soaked so I had to bring it back again so they could rip the carpet out.."
"Jan 01","2013","Wrangler Rubicon 3.6L V6","Head Has To Be Replaced","13,500 miles","Jeep is expecting the local techs to rebuild my engine and expect that the consumer to be OK with this. I expect that they give a retail trade on this or replace the entire engine. This was a purchase that I wanted to keep forever, I'll never purchase another Jeep."
