"Sep 14","2019","Civic LX-S 1.8L","Clear Coat Peeling","125,500 miles","Paint on these cars are really bad. I washed the car, applied wax, then a few days later I see chips on my left fender. Here's what you should do - get a touch up paint at a body shop, then after a week, get the car plasti dipped. The car may not look as cool as you want it to but will protect the paint from about 3 years and you can reapply it again. Or maybe go with ceramic coating if plasti dip ain't your thing."
"May 01","2020","Civic","Clear Coat Peeling","62,000 miles","Nice to know it's not just me with the same problem. What irks me is a manufacturer who sees there's a problem with something and they don't acknowledge it. Oh well."
"Aug 10","2016","Civic Coupe 3.2L","Clear Coat Peeling","45,360 miles","I'm surprised Honda is not admitting that there is a problem."
"Jun 01","2016","Civic DX 4 Door 4","Clear Coat Peeling","40,389 miles","My 2009 Honda looks awful! The clear-coat is peeling very badly. I feel there should be a recall from Honda regarding this since I've noticed a lot of Hondas, especially with this color, experiencing the same issue. It's terrible. I 'baby' my vehicles but this looks incredibly bad. Why isn't there a 'recall' on this? If this is not rectified by Honda, I will not be purchasing any more of your vehicles, that's for certain."
"Jan 01","2020","Civic LX","Clear Coat Peeling","88,000 miles","Body paint shop says $800 to repair!!!"
"May 05","2017","Civic EX","Clear Coat Peeling","51,000 miles","Honda cars appear to have a paint/clear top coat peeling issue. I went to 3 different autobody shops and was told the same thing. You have to repaint the whole car. This means $4500.00 and 10 days to 3 weeks without my car. Not acceptable. Considering this is a frequent complaint with Honda owners, Honda should be doing something about this. This is not my family's first Honda as they are generally good cars that last a long time. However, I would not recommend this car without adding the peeling issue so the buyer is warned."
"Feb 01","2017","Civic ES 1.3L","Clear Coat Peeling","96,934 miles","I'll start by saying, I love my Honda. But, it looks awful!!!! The clear coat on the roof is DISGUSTING to look at. It looks like the car is rotting."
"Apr 01","2015","Civic ES","Clear Coat Peeling","50,000 miles","The clear coat is totally peeling from my car, it started years ago, when I contacted Honda about it, they told me there was a recall but I had missed it by nearly a year. When I told them that I never was notified of the recall, they said I had to contact them to find out about it and there was not recall notice sent out to owners. The workers at my Honda dealership told me that the dark blue civics were mainly affected by the clear coat peeling. It looks so awful, its f*cking embarrassing to be driving my civic with it looking like Brillo was used to rub the clear coat off. Now I drive my car around and tell people this is what to expect when you buy a Honda. I hope Honda enjoys all the free advertising that I am giving them about the quality of Honda paint jobs and how they have ""silent"" recalls. Who would ever think to call and ask if a recall is out there? Very disappointed with this company."
"Jan 03","2016","Civic CXG","Clear Coat Peeling","99,419 miles","Hondas are generally great cars, but this has been a game changer. Everything works well, but it looks like garbage and is quickly getting worse. It brings down resale and it's not a car I feel good driving around! I will definitely go Toyota for my next vehicle."
"Jan 01","2018","Civic","Clear Coat Peeling","115,000 miles","I am (or should I say, was) the very proud owner of a red 2009 Honda Civic Sedan. I take exceptional care of my car, keeping it out of the weather whenever possible, washing and waxing regularly, and cleaning the inside weekly. The car has never been in any type of wreck (knock on wood) and I've never had a ticket. I absolutely love my car and thoroughly enjoyed driving it - until the beginning of this year. I noticed that the paint on the roof of my Civic where the body meets the back windshield was dull, beginning to turn white. In just a few short months, the paint has peeled all across the roof of my car and the clear coat has failed badly."
"Mar 01","2018","Civic SI 2.O","Clear Coat Peeling","105,633 miles","Definitely unacceptable to have these faded spots on same area of two cars. One a CSX and the other a Civic that's parked in the garage. I am yet to visit a dealer or paint shop because I thought it wiser to visit these forums first to get a feel of how many are experiencing this same issue before proceeding."
"Mar 01","2018","Civic LX","Clear Coat Peeling","91,342 miles","There are several Honda Civics that have the same problem in my family. We have Civic's all doing the same thing. Frustrating."
"May 01","2015","Civic LX 1.8L","Clear Coat Peeling","50,000 miles","I have noticed this problem on similar vehicles. Recalls were made, however I was never notified. It is becoming worse as time goes on."
"Mar 20","2011","Civic GX","Clear Coat Peeling","57,788 miles","The dealers (2 different ones) said it was environmental and normal. The car was garage kept for most of its life. An auto paint technician says it is definitely a paint defect. The Honda Customer Support says its not their problem. I have a 2004 vehicle that is five years older and it has no issues with the paint. The car looks horrible and because of that does not have the book value that it should for a 2009. I would repaint it myself but it's not worth it."
"Jan 01","2017","Civic EX","Clear Coat Peeling","69,000 miles","Bought the 2009 Civic new, then about a year to year and a half ago noted what looked to be tree sap damage on the roof of the car. It was relatively small blotches, but over time grew to what is seen in the photo. Well a couple of months ago my wife decides to take the car to a local body shop to get it fixed. That where she learned it was the clear coat that was failing and Honda did have a ""Technical Service Bulletin"" and had extended the paint warranty to 7 years. Great didn't do us any good since we just found about it a year after the extended warranty period had ended. Honda certainly didn't want that news out there."
"Feb 01","2016","Civic EX 3.2L","Clear Coat Peeling","39,000 miles","I bought a Honda Civic EX used in 2014 with 37,700 miles. No peeling or informed that this may be a problem. Surprise, surprise!"
"Aug 01","2016","Civic","Clear Coat Peeling","87,000 miles","My car runs great, but looks like a piece of crap! I took it to Honda to find they want to cover 25% of the cost to repair this issue. I was told by the body shop manager that he sees this issue all the time."
"Sep 01","2016","Civic EX","Clear Coat Peeling","75,000 miles","The paint on the roof has failed in the front and back, the trunk is beginning to fail."
"Jan 04","2016","Civic SI 4","Clear Coat Peeling","80,000 miles","The roof of my 2009 Honda Civic Si has the clear coat peeling off and it would need to be repainted. If this is a common issue as I'm just discovering, why hasn't Honda issued a recall? I take good care of this car, it has been parked in a garage nearly every night but it has had its share of no cover in the Texas heat. I will have a hard time reselling this vehicle and it will need to be repainted. Honda should pay for it, not me."
"Apr 12","2013","Civic EX 1.8L","Clear Coat Peeling","21,000 miles","I had bought my 2009 Honda Civic brand new and just two and a half years later the clear coat had started to crack on multiple panels. Luckily I had caught the problem early before any major damage could be done to the paint. I was still under warranty so Honda was able to take it to a local shop and get the entire car repainted free of charge to me. I was extremely happy when the car came back looking brand new again but that didn't make the problem any less annoying to deal with."
