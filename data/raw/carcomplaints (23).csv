"Mar 30","2007","Silverado LX Vortec5300 V8","Knocking Noise From Engine","50,000 miles","seems all gm chevy silverado truck owners are having the same problem the engine knocking. Want to know if anybody has heard from chevy to attend to the situation. Apparently NOT!!. Live in OH. already had to replace the whole damn brake lines ( rotted ) repl with ss lines. Now trouble with the fuel system. have 157,000 miles and I have records from the very start when I bought the truck new. So what do we do? Bitch and complain and yet we still haven't heard from chevy. If you do please let me know. I've complained for years and they only laugh in my face, as they are doing to you. happy trails"
"Mar 11","2010","Silverado LT 5.3L","Knocking Noise From Engine","130,000 miles","The engine started knocking and has progressively gotten worse. I have read some of the other complaints and I believe it is due to the oil pump or something along that line. I say this because as this first began I could start my truck and there would be NO Noise. After about 20 seconds it would sound like the lifters had pumped down and were out of oil. Then about another 10 seconds and they would pump back up. Now they are getting louder and it not only starts as soon as you start the truck, it is louder. I have owned Chevrolet vehicles for probably 35 years and this will be the last. It really pisses me off when a company knows there is a problem and will not fix it. Two other problems that I know many folks have had is the passenger window motor going out and the rear brakes as well. I rarely ever used my passenger window and had to have it replaced. Additionally, I had used my emergency brakes only 3 or 4 times and the back brakes went out. They said it was from lack of use. Come on!"
"Feb 03","2000","Silverado LS 6.0L","Knocking Noise From Engine","0 miles","My 2000 K2500 6.0L 5sp manual truck has made knocking noises from day one, only for several minutes when you first start it. It now as 60k miles and makes the same noise. I have always changed oil at 3000 miles with an extended mileage frame filter or better. I use 15w45 mobile one synthetic oil. I just added a half bottle of Hyper-lube for zinc replacement it quieted down a little bit. It has never let me down. It has been a good truck despite the noise."
"Jun 09","2011","Silverado LX 5.3L V8","Knocking Noise From Engine","150,000 miles","Chevy Need to Recall all 5.3 L V8's & 6.L V8 for their Engine Noies on Start Up. It's going to require a complete engine replacement."
"Oct 01","2009","Silverado LS 6.0L V8","Knocking Noise From Engine","198,000 miles","Engine made a terrible knocking noise when cold, sounded like a poorly performing diesel engine to be honest. My fix; complete rebuild. I read a ton of forums discussing this problem and most thoughts were piston slap or low oil pressure. When i checked the clearances after 200,000 miles: the cylinder's were not even 0.001"" out of spec, piston slap is not the issue. The rebuild got all new pistons, new bearings, bored over cylinders. The low oil pressure? I did have poor oil pressure when I bought the truck, something like 45-50PSi hot and the pressure would get higher as the truck warmed up which to this day baffles me. To correct the oil pressure during the rebuild I put a high volume SLP camaro oil pump in. Now 80PSi cold and 60PSi hot idle. After the rebuild, not a lick of knock. I bought the truck with 167,000miles on it so i thought nothing of the issue, until my 2004 5.3l just started doing it at 145,000 as well... now I am confident its an issue related specifically to the LS based Vortec family of engines."
"Jun 15","2001","Silverado LT 6.0L","Knocking Noise From Engine","25,000 miles","I developed an engine knock around 25,000 miles. I purchased the truck brand new with 7 miles on it for around $30,000. I am completely disgusted with GM for the run around that they have there dealers try and pass on to there customers. I have listened to every excuse from carbon build up to the way that the engines are made and assembled. I will not purchase another GM truck. I had to learn my lesson the hard and expensive way so by reading this please don't repeat my mistake. So after 11 years and the warranty long since come and gone the trucks engine still knocks and I was unable to get anything done about it. The government should have let GM go out of business since they brought it upon themselves making such poorly engineered autos that no one wants to buy more than once."
"Feb 18","2009","Silverado 5.3 vortec","Knocking Noise From Engine","87,000 miles","I am hoping that GM will step up and take care my problem and other peoples problems. They got a bailout to stay in business, they need fix my problem please."
"Jan 10","2010","Silverado LS 5.4L V8","Knocking Noise From Engine","90,000 miles","This is a very annoying problem which I have been told cannot be fixed. Truck knocks like it has been abused, although I maintain my vehicles very well. When the engine is cold, it knocks so badly it sounds like it is going to fall apart. When it's warm, you can hear, but not so loud. It's rather embarrassing to drive it sometimes with it knocking like that."
"Aug 02","2010","Silverado LS 5.3L V8","Knocking Noise From Engine","145,000 miles","There is a knocking noise from the engine. I also hear this clacking noise in the mornings. What is the fix?"
"Dec 11","2008","Silverado SE 5.2L V8","Knocking Noise From Engine","68,000 miles","I BOUGHT THIS VEHICLE SECOND HAND IN DECEMBER. THE SALES PERSON WAS KIND AND STARTED THE TRUCK FOR ME SO IT WOULD BE WARMED UP WHEN I TOOK THE TEST DRIVE AND WHEN I TOOK IT HOME. ASIDE FROM BEING TAKEN FOR ANOTHER KIND OF RIDE, I LIKE THE TRUCK. THE TRUCK HAS THE SAME PROBLEMS DESCRIBED IN THE OTHER COMPLAINTS. AFTER SPEAKING TO SEVERAL MACHANIC AND TWO AUTOMOTIVE ENGINEERS MOST CONCLUDED THE PROBLEM IS NOT PISTON SLAP BUT LACK OF OIL TO THE LIFTER OR LIFTERS. THEY BELIEVED GMC KNOWS THIS AND PERFERS TO CALL IT PISTON SLAP OF NO CONCERN. THEY BELIEVE THE OIL DRAINS AWAY FROM THE TROTH AND IS NOT AVAILABLE ON START-UP."
"Mar 10","2009","Silverado LS 5.3L V8","Knocking Noise From Engine","60,000 miles","I BOUGHT THIS TRUCK NEW AND HAVE HAD VERY FEW PROBLEMS OVER THE TEN YEARS I HAVE HAD IT. I DO NOT DRIVE THIS MUCH AND HAVE ONLY 69K ON IT. I HAVE TRIED SYNTHETIC OIL AND EVEN SOME ADDITIVES AND STILL WHEN I START IT YOU WOULD SWEAR IT IS A DIESEL FOR A FEW MINUTES. I DO NOT PLAN ON GETTING A NEW TRUCK BUT IF I WERE AND WOULD TRY TO SELL IT WITH THIS KNOCK I WOULD HAVE A HARD TIME, I HOPE SOMEONE HAS A SOLUTION TO THIS PROBLEM."
"Feb 02","2010","Silverado LS 5.3L V8","Knocking Noise From Engine","160,000 miles","I bought this vehicle new in 2000 and after about 30,000 miles, the engine developed a knock or piston slap when engine is cold. After engine warms up about 1-2 minutes, the knock will stop. The vehicle now has about 160,000 miles on it (all highway miles, no load) and the knock is louder and lasts longer each morning when I crank it up. I have tried changing oil viscosity from 10w30 to 5w30 but knock has persisted. Does anyone out there know if a synthetic oil will help this problem?"
"Jan 07","2010","Silverado LT 5.3L V8","Knocking Noise From Engine","100,000 miles","When first starting the truck cold, for the first 10-60 seconds there is a loud enigine knock. This is pretty embarrassing when your truck knocks only at 100,000 miles. Ive have done every oil fluid change myself at 3,000 miles everytime. This is a serious problem, piston slap, and i think chevrolet should recall this because it seems like to me alot of people have the same problem."
"Nov 01","2000","Silverado LS 5.3L V8","Knocking Noise From Engine","45,000 miles","Called and talked to the head mechanic at the dealership about the knocking noise when the engine is completely cool which when started the knocking sound would last about 10 to 60 seconds then goes away. He suggested to use a full synthetic oil between one regular oil change, should help reduce but not make the noise go away. I took his advice and he was right, however I noticed before I bought the truck that they where using 5w30 oil which is recommended by the truck manual, which I went to a 10w30 which also helped. I still don't think this is right though with so many people having the same problem and I wish there was some way to contact whoever to make this a recall matter and have them fix this problem because I believe this soon will be a costly repair to the engine if not corrected."
"Oct 10","2009","Silverado Z71 5.3L","Knocking Noise From Engine","90,000 miles","I think the motor should be replaced by GM with the amount of complaints about this ."
"Feb 13","2004","Silverado 5.3L","Knocking Noise From Engine","36,000 miles","I bought this truck in 2004. It had 36000 miles on it so there was no warranty. I drove the vehicle for several months and then it would start making a knocking sound every moring I started it up. It would do it worse when it was cold outside. I took it to the dealership were I bought it from and explained what the truck was doing and the manager said that it was normal that those motors were built loose to keep them from locking up.I have complained about this for several years and now I have 102.000 miles on the truck and the noise is getting worse. I think that this is a manufacture defect and General Motors should fix or replace these motors.If it gets any worse which it will.I will trade it in on a japenese vehicle and never go back to G.M. It is bad that american made vehicles are built so poorly and the overseas vehicles are lasting forever. Remember bad product bad name."
"Sep 01","2006","Silverado LS 5.3L V8","Knocking Noise From Engine","130,000 miles","This is a known issue with these motors. Not sure it affects it's lifespan or not but embarrassing to start it and have it knocking, looks to others like you don't take care of your vehicle."
"Feb 18","2009","Silverado 1500 Z71 5.3L","Knocking Noise From Engine","276,510 miles","Excessive knocking, My low oil Pressure light came on. I needed to buy a new engine... sucks real badly... nothing i could do."
"Feb 26","2006","Silverado LS Z71 5.3L","Knocking Noise From Engine","103,000 miles","WHEN I FIRST GOT THIS TRUCK IN FEB IT DIDN'T DO IT BUT AS TIME WENT ON IT STARTED WHEN YOU STARTED THE TRUCK NOW PRESENT DAY 50,000 MILES LATER (103,000) IT DOES IT WHILE IM DRIVING I CANT BELIEVE CHEVY PUT A ENGINE LIKE THIS ON THE MARKET AND WONT BOTHER FIXING IT NO WANDER THEY ARE GOING BROKE .
