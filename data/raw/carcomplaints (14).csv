"Mar 31","2017","ML350 V6","Car Shuts Down While Driving","19,000 miles","I own a 2014 ml350 benz and felt safe in it until March 31st 2017. I was driving to work the same way I always go and the engine shut off and the steering wheel locked up on me, and no brakes so it caused an accident. That morning my husband took the car to sarasota fl mercedes dealership to have it looked at...well the dealership said that they did some diagnostic tests and nothing was wrong with the suv and that it was fine and that they did some software updates, I called the mercedes headquarters in new jersey and they said to me that it had to happen again for them to do anything about...really. I think that the benz dealership knows what was wrong with my suv and did not want to claim responsibility for my damage"
