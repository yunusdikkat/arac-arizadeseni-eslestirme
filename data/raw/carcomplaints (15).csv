"Jun 15","2021","Wrangler COD 3.6L","Tipm Failure","101,000 miles","I have loved my wrangler until now. At 100,000 it started doing this thing where sometimes it will crank, then shut off. To get it actually start I have to turn it off and back on. Had a mechanic look at it, and he said oh your horn is bad... Well, so is the a/c and it has not been working well. He says, well it's not the starter or alternator. Of course, the Jeep doesn't do it in his time working on it. Now it's doing it again randomly. When I go to start, it sometimes just cranks but not starts."
"May 24","2020","Wrangler Sport V6","Tipm Failure","76,000 miles","I've had my Jeep Wrangler Sport 2012 for about 2 years. I've driven it cross country and its been great to have however it has always been electrically quirky. Yesterday it refused to turn on, the dash went dead, the starter wouldn't work, then the dash totally illuminated with all lights turning on, then fading. It would not respond to a jump. Had to have it towed to my house."
"Mar 09","2020","Wrangler Rubicon Unlimited 3.6L V6","Tipm Failure","124,000 miles","Started as door locks not working to no start unless you hit the tipm. Would love to just replace it but it is on nationwide back order it sounds like it's a big problem with Jeeps an told at the dealership that just be glad that it doesn't just shut off on you but it's not under recall for the Wrangler."
"May 16","2019","Wrangler Linited","Tipm Failure","82,030 miles","Sudden loss of power from Alternator, Radio reboot, loss of AC. Vehicle staggered for a moment then continued on battery power. Low speed with each happening = TIPM is getting hot and faulting."
"Jun 30","2018","Wrangler Sport 6","Tipm Failure","95,000 miles","We have had problems with our 2012 Jeep Wrangler Sport since we bought it. It's been in dealer many times and they have replaced so much, but it stumps them. About a month now it is back to it again. We can wiggle the starter relay in the fuse panel and it will start. We keep telling the dealer but they don't listen. I know that there is something wrong with the fuse panel box and Chrysler needs to step up and fix this problem."
"Sep 20","2018","Wrangler Unlimited","Tipm Failure","110,000 miles","So fed up with this Jeep...2012..so excited to purchase my 2nd Jeep. First week, air conditioner goes out spontaneously while driving. Does this every now and then but I let it go. 2018 and the piece of  has gone crazy. Dash lights coming on, wipers come on when I give a right turn signal, radio cuts off, air still shutting off while driving. Last week, going to the store and the Jeep doesn't crank...dead...completely. Heard a ticking under the hood near the fuse box, pound the fuse box, the ticking stops. Jeep cranks up but no radio, nothing, dead. Another company where the fat cats keep getting rich and those of us working our asses off keep shoveling out hard earned cash for their piece of crap product. I knew something was up in 2012...just didn't seem right. It was brand new, straight off the truck. Very disappointed."
"Sep 03","2018","Wrangler Sport 3.6L V6","Tipm Failure","47,923 miles","Cannot use 2012 Jeep Wrangler because exterior lights and directionals do not work. The estimate to replace the tipm (fuse box) is over $1000.00 USD. I have been told this is a common problem and a defect, yet I am supposed to pay for the repairs. Not fair. Too much money."
"Nov 30","2016","Wrangler Unlimited 3.2L V6","Tipm Failure","34,175 miles","The front winter washer does not work, but the rear works. The electronic lock does not work, but the unlock works, the high beams do not work."
"Jul 01","2017","Wrangler Sahara 3.6V6","Tipm Failure","51,000 miles","There are multiple issues/problems with the electrical components that from my research online are common enough that they should be fixed under a recall."
"May 16","2017","Wrangler Sahara 3.6L","Tipm Failure","41,213 miles","Check engine light came on, drove to nearest auto parts store with a code reader. As I arrived the overheating alarm went off. Checked code cooling fan or circuit. Since I was towing the vehicle and we were on the road I immediately contacted a Jeep dealer first one acted uninterested when I said something about an extended warranty The second one was very responsive I could Drive the vehicle without AC and no stop and go traffic"
"Sep 05","2017","Wrangler","Tipm Failure","50,000 miles","9/4/17 while driving home, I noticed I could not control the radio with the steering wheel controls, no big deal."
"Jul 14","2016","Wrangler Sport 3.6L","Tipm Failure","40,000 miles","2012 Jeep Wrangler with 40000 miles. Started overheating. Had towed to dealer. Dealer diagnosed bad fan and fan mod. $1000."
"Oct 03","2016","Wrangler Rubicon 3.6L","Tipm Failure","39,850 miles","This all started when I had the Calibration done for the larger tires. The transmission acted like it was not going into the proper gear while driving, a week or so later the A/C unit would shut off for a few seconds and come back on. Still had the transmission problems not shifting correctly, Then the wiper motor would come on intermittently (Transmission, A/C and Wiper Motor not working Correctly)."
"Dec 15","2016","Wrangler JK 3.2L V6","Tipm Failure","42,000 miles","A few months ago, our fob would only unlock the driver side door. After getting in, all other doors need to be unlocked manually (the door button doesn't do anything). I finally brought it into my mechanic and he diagnosed it as the TIPM and said it would be about $1100 to fix. In addition to this, I apparently need a brake fluid flush, new lug nut bolt (since one rusted and fell of), and new rear brakes. I'm baffled as to why a vehicle with only 43,000 miles on it would have these issues. The next time someone asks me if I like my Jeep, I don't think I can tell them yes - especially after hearing other peoples TIPM issues..."
"Mar 01","2017","Wrangler Sport 3.6L","Tipm Failure","94,448 miles","Starter runs on after engine is running when it's cold ."
"Jan 01","2015","Wrangler Sport 3.6L","Tipm Failure","46,603 miles","No wipers, no fog lights, no radio, no abs, no traction control, no cruise control."
"Feb 01","2017","Wrangler Rubicon 3.6L V6","Tipm Failure","83,614 miles","The washer fluid stopped spraying, and the power door locks are not working for now. Middle of winter I'd rather hook a Supersoaker up to it and lock the doors manually than pay $1100 rro a  part."
"Jan 18","2017","Wrangler Unlimited 3.6L V6","Tipm Failure","60,684 miles","This jeep has been great until we found out that they have TIPM problems. Almost completely wrecked out ride. Not to mention the stress of the death wobbles and never knowing what it's going to drive like today. It's costing us over $3000 to fix it! I really wish Jeep would do something for this make and model to help us out!"
"Jun 10","2016","Wrangler Unlimited Rubicon","Tipm Failure","55,000 miles","Jeep went haywire. Went into limp mode. Away bar wouldn't disconnect or reconnect if disconnected. Loss of power. Intermittent air conditioner failure. Stalling while idle. Stalling while driving. Dealing with the dealer was a complete joke. They had the jeep for 3 weeks and didn't do anything until I showed up ranting and screaming to finish. Wondering if they even replaced the tipm they charged me for."
"Sep 09","2016","Wrangler X 3.6L V6","Tipm Failure","35,000 miles","The TIPM is an on going issue with Jeep and Chrysler vehicles. Most of the jeep vehicles in 2012 were recalled due to the TIPM issues but not the wrangler. I got in my jeep and everything was fine until I turned the key. ALL the lights on my dash stated flashing but would not do anything else. This happed after 4 years and 35K miles. I have open a case with Jeep customer care and now awaiting a case worker to call me. I dont expect them to do much of anything because I am out of the basic warranty. However if enough people call about this issue maybe they will finally acknowledge the issue is also with the Wrangler ."
