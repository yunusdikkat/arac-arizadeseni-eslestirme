"Mar 16","2024","Focus SE 2.0L","Power Steering Failure","86,000 miles","The third rack that has failed in this car.Given the common nature, would expect Ford to have steering racks available with the problem fixed."
"Dec 25","2019","Focus SE 2.4L","Power Steering Failure","93,000 miles","The power steering failure light came on in our 2012 Ford Focus on Christmas and the steering never came back. The light had came on in the past and usually turning off the car and turning it back on helped. Now it's just done for good. The cost is going to be around $1500 to fix this stupid car. Ford is a piece of crap company who sells poorly built vehicles. How many people are going to need to wreck and die because the steering goes out while they are driving? There are hundreds, if not thousands of posts on a lot of other websites concerning peoples' Focuses and the steering. Ford needs to recall this and fix this problem asap."
"Sep 19","2019","Focus SEL 2.0L","Power Steering Failure","86,903 miles","I bought a 2012 focus SEL with 43000 miles on 1/15/2014. I drove from NC. to CA. 2 months later and never had a problem, then 6 months after that, I would get random alerts saying ""Steering Assist Failure"" but I could turn off the car and restarted it and it would go away. When the message came up you lost all steering assist and it goes into manual. On Thur. Sept. 26, 2019, at 6:30am as I starting driving doing about 25 mph, it came on and I lost all steering. As I slowed down and started a turn, the wheels locked up and the car went up the curb and hit a cinder block wall.I have looked up this problem before and knew my time was coming but hoped FORD would do the right thing and recall the Focus as well as the other they did with the same problem. Next step is reporting it to NTSB. I do not have the $3125.00 to fix this. You would have thought the car industry learned from the GM screw up but I guess not."
"Mar 31","2022","Focus EX 2.0L 4 cyl",Power Steering Failure","115,000 miles","This is a warning to ALL 2012 Ford Focus with Electronic Steering issues: IT WILL FAIL the SAFETY portion of inspections, and it WILL COST thousands of dollars to have it fixed! Design flaw FROM FORD DESTROYS the ELECTRONIC BOX located 3 (THREE) inches away from the exhaust manifold causing the casing to become super hot and DESTROYS the INTERNAL COMPONENTS that ""power steers"" the vehicle.This is a MAJOR SAFETY ISSUE that Ford knows about but has done NOTHING to address this issue with the Ford Focus, BUT HAS addressed this issue with OTHER MAKES/MODELS with the SAME UNIT. WHY have they NOT RECALLED this make/model/year of vehicle when THEY KNOW about this problem, along with the NTSB?"
"Feb 15","2022","Focus SE","Power Steering Failure","76,835 miles","I am the owner of a 2012 Ford Focus SE and I bought the vehicle in 2018. My car has recently developed a power steering failure, making the car unsafe to drive. I took the car into Ford and they quoted me $3,648.23 (Canadian) to replace the steering gear. I recently spent $1,300 to replace the front ball joints and now together with this next issue, there is a total of almost $5,000 in repairs I have had to make in the last 3 months of my four years of owning it. The car itself is 10 years old, and should not already have issues like this. The repairs alone are costing more than the Ford Focus is even worth."
"Dec 18","2021","Focus SE","Power Steering Failure","76,000 miles","Steering assist malfunction occurs intermittently when starting the vehicle. This is the second time within the same week. The steering wheel is very difficult to turn, Restarting the vehicle clears the problem. I have not had this diagnosed yet, but per the internet it appears Ford does not have a fix for this issue. This could be extremely serious if the failure occurs while driving. I will bring this up when I go in for the next oil change."
"Feb 13","2020","Focus SEL 4 Speed","Power Steering Failure","79,355 miles","I've had this issues since I got the car. At first it would be 1 to 2 minutes, and then it would be all good. There's no issues with turning the sterling wheel. I mostly had issues when it was cold but there were at lease 6 times when they weather was just fine. I called in and talked to them but when they got the car the issue was ""fine"" and they said if its not doing it then they can't tell me what's wrong.Now, it's gone out completely, it will cost $2540 dollars and the value of my car is 3000 to 4000 (2012 Ford Focus) - but with the issue not fixed, it's actually worth 1 to 2 thousand. I'm now getting a new car and that wasn't the plan."
"Sep 18","2020","Focus 2.0L","Power Steering Failure","83,000 miles","Got the car - it had 58000 miles on it when I bought it. Now at 83000 miles, the steering assist lights up and it is hard to steer. I am disabled - it should be covered but it is not. I don't have much money to fix it and I am getting real upset - they all want an ATM and a leg to fix problem."
"Oct 15","2020","Focus SE 2.0L","Power Steering Failure","77,000 miles","I doubt this will got any further then the front door as hundreds have come forward over power assist issue or fault. The dealerships and head executives could give a flip less. I have a dealer that lies, says work has been done and it hasn't. Ford won't admit it and the codes in the 13 Fusion recalls in my opinion could be different in the 12 Focus ones they won't admit.After several days - yes, I'm very mechanical, I have some software experience. First the code u3000-53 deactivated pscm... Well and the ground issues they have and the 300 other issues, this is a really good scenario. The ecm, bcm and several modules talk and the worthless bsm on the neg and the corn head that decided to make a neg on paint, congrats!I checked voltage live feeds acc feeds - you name it, I did it..."
"Jul 20","2016","Focus SE I4","Power Steering Failure","50,000 miles","Power steering was intermittent since 2014, especially on hot days. Then finally in July 2016 the power steering completely failed. Prior to this Ford was unable to diagnose the issue if it was not actively occurring. . In 2019 I brought the vehicle in for a couple recall fixes and asked them to check the steering. They stated it would have to replace the entire electrical power steering unit for ~$2,500. Repair was not conducted.I had read in forums that this brand new (at the time) all electric power steering unit was placed too close to the engine exhaust manifold and too poorly heat shielded, frying the electrics. Rumor is that not enough reports of the issue, or deaths associated to loss of power steering while driving have occurred for Ford to issue a recall. Hopefully, this complaint helps."
"Jan 16","2021","Focus SEL 2.0L","Power Steering Failure","230,000 miles","Power steering stopped working while turning at 30+ MPH, and steering failed to return to center. I had to muscle the steering wheel back (I was headed into oncoming traffic) with the grip I had and tore a tendon in my elbow. Needless to say the one armed drive home was awesome. I have Ford IDS software and sure enough the PSCM, SASM were not communicating, which also shuts down ABS and EPAS, I now have the most dangerous vehicle on the road, LOOK OUT."
"Jan 08","2021","Focus SEL 2.0L","Power Steering Failure","105,000 miles","There has been many issues with this and a lawsuit was filed."
"Nov 22","2020","Focus SEL 2.0L 4 cyl","Power Steering Failure","129,285 miles","Sitting in my driveway getting ready to leave for work steering assist fault service pops up on info center. Steering wheel wouldn't turn. Shut the car off and restart disappears. I drive the 8 miles to work no problems. Park, shut the car off, start it back up and it popped up again. Same issue as the first time.The dealership I purchased the car from didn't mention this issue, only the transmission one. I've only had this car since Feb 2020. I am not happy with the amount of issues I've had with this car."
"May 22","2021","Focus SE","Power Steering Failure","115,111 miles","Ford needs to do a RECALL for the Power Steering Component Malfunction, especially since it's a common issue. How many people need to report a problem before the Ford company realizes they need to fix it?"
"Apr 16","2020","Focus SE","Power Steering Failure","91,000 miles","My complaint at 91000 is my power steering assist light comes on and I cannot drive the car. So I had it towed down to Ford in Sumner. I was told the for just the part to repair the steering gear it will cost $1441.00 and the labor will be $784.00.I have bought 3 Focuses over the years and I will say that Ford is taking everyone money and not caring. How many people is it going to take for the Ford Motor Company to take responsibility for the piece of garbage car they they created or should hundreds die or seriously get injured before something is done."
"Mar 15","2020","Focus SE Sport 2L I4",Power Steering Failure","120,000 miles","Took my sonâ€™s Focus in for a recall on the fuel tank valve. Dealer completed the recall repair and attempted to restart the vehicle. The power steering out warning turned on and they could not clear it. Service manager contacted Ford and was informed that it would not be covered in any way. Repair is $2600 to replace the electronic power steering module or $1600 for a salvage non-warranty used part. Hard to stomach on a car with a $2000 trade-in value or $4500 private seller value. Why no recall on the Focus when Multiple other Ford models with the same problem were recalled? Ridiculous. We are done with Ford forever."
"Jul 22","2019","Focus SE 4 cyl","Power Steering Failure","89,000 miles","OVERVIEW:- Lose control of the car randomly- Two Ford dealers have no idea why- Mechanic told me he has seen this before- Unsure if fix will resolve problem for good or is this Temp, no one can answer? DETAIL:My daughter and my wife experienced this, it is my daughters car and a couple of times now she has lost all control with the steering of the car. All the lights on the dash come and she does her best to get it to side of road. First time she was not sure what to do and left it there to have people come by and push it, only to restart and everything was just fine. She thought it was her fault so she didn't mention the first time, the second time she asked why it did that? A few weeks later my wife took the car out and it happened to her only she was doing about 45mph, she panicked, luckily for her no one was around."
"Aug 09","2019","Focus LX 3.2L V6","Power Steering Failure","124,000 miles","Very dangerous to be driving down a main highway going 75 miles per hour and lose power steering. I understand it is a default of the company making this car. I have had many recalls on different things with this car. I am leery of driving far with my car anywhere."
"Aug 18","2019","Focus SE Sport 2.0L","Power Steering Failure","55,000 miles","Son returning to college had steering wheel become so hard to turn, he ran into the shoulder attempting to exit the freeway. A little searching found hundreds of Ford steering module failures and many recalls on other Ford models with failure of the same part. Is Ford waiting for more people to get killed before issuing a recall? UPDATE - Dealer updated software for $250. It did not work so a complete steering module replacement is required, which cost almost $3000. Absolutely, terrible customer service by Ford."
"Mar 28","2018","Focus LS 2.0L I4",Power Steering Failure","31,000 miles","Intermittently at random times the power in the power steering would fail creating a dangerous situation. Control of the vehicle would become difficult because of the large increase in effort to control the vehicle steering. Turning the vehicle off for a few minutes usually remedied the problem after you'd been scared to death from the loss of power steering. Steering control module was reset by local auto shop. They said there wasn't much they could do short of starting to replace parts in the system. They suggested taking the vehicle to a Ford Dealer because it was an ongoing issue with 2012 Ford Focus'.After 4 months the power steering completely failed. We took it to Fremont Ford in Fremont/Newark, CA. Big mistake on our part, it took them 1 day shy of 3 weeks with many un-returned calls. Ended up filing a complaint, Case #CAS14608637 with Ford to regarding the dealer and power steering failure situation.According to Fremont Ford, the cause of the power steering failure was the DMC connector, associated wiring from the steering computer to the steering module and the steering module/steering gear. Total cost for diagnosis, parts and labor was $2802.38. This is my daughter's car and I thank God that she was able to maintain control of the vehicle when the power steering failed. I truly believe this is a serious safety defect in the vehicle."
