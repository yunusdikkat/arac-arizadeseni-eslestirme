"Jul 20","2017","Fiesta","Transmission Failed","39,234 miles","Since 2011, there have been numerous issues. The vehicle has not reached 40,000 miles because there is always something wrong with it. As of now, there is transmission failure, jerking, shuddering, electrical problems, and steering problems. Also, the engine dies while driving. I want to get rid of it, but CarMax told the vehicle is worthless in its condition. This car has been a nightmare."
"Mar 18","2017","Fiesta","Transmission Failed","50,013 miles","I have had this car for just over a year, but have only driven it for 21 days. The car currently is at Ford dealership where they replaced transmission clutch and transmission modulator and other minor things. They called me to come get my car, it was fixed. So I drive there, pay a repair bill and get my key..however I didn't make it off the lot when I heard horrible grinding noises. I took key right back inside and told them this is not fixed, something is not right..keep in mind I never left the lot with my car. They had my car for another 3 months then finally call and tell me, oh your car needs a whole new transmission....another 3000$!!! This year, make and model car has an extended warranty for 100,000 miles....this car only has 50,000 on it....they are telling me warranty won't cover new transmission. Who can I contact, where do I turn? This is unjust and unfair.."
"Jan 06","2017","Fiesta","Transmission Failed","37,000 miles","I will NEVER be purchasing a Ford vehicle or item ever again. I received the absolute WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE when I called them and explained that my 2011 Ford Fiesta with 37K miles on it was in the shop for the SECOND TIME for a transmission issue and needed a new transmission and requested that they assist, they said that I am 3 months out of warranty and that they couldn't help me. They sold me a  PRODUCT, they KNOW has TRANSMISSION ISSUES. Take responsibility for your LEMON OF A CAR and give me the customer Service that I deserve. I have called MULTIPLE TIMES asking for a call back, and no one responds to me. I am not afraid to take this to court and will keep reaching out until this is resolved"
"Oct 20","2016","Fiesta","Transmission Failed","106,000 miles","I was reading a comment posted by another 2011 ford fiesta owner with a similar problem and after reading their comment I agree. I have always had a quality vehicle Navigator, Mustang, F150, and an old f100 but this vehicle has killed all fords for me. I have had the throttle body replaced around 30k, the alternator around 40k, the fan actually caught on fire at the dealership while diagnosing my a/c and it took them 2 weeks to fix that, then from 55-100k the vehicle did not have ANY issues which I was happy with. Then in October my transmission goes out....I paid to have it pulled by AAMCO and there is a seal on the interior of the shift linkage that was busted and I had the slave cylinder, throw out bearing(part of the slave cylinder) and clutch kit replaced. After this was completed the vehicle still doesn't go into gear and I'm now in need of a rebuild because the synchronizers are needing replacement. This is the last Ford that my family or I will ever purchase."
"Mar 14","2015","Fiesta SE 4 cyl,"Transmission Failed","42,000 miles","We bought this Fiesta in February 2015. We have had so many problems since then. I strongly believe that the dealership knew of the problem that the car had before selling it to us. When we go to drive it there is grinding from 1st to 2nd. As well as it grinding from 2nd to 3rd sometimes. We have very little to no power in the transmission at all. The recalls that came out on the car not long after we bought it, have never been performed by the dealership. They had told us ""We will call you when we get the parts in, but the car will not drive any differently"" Well obviously that is not true. This is my fiance's daily driver and we are so troubled about this. If this transmission goes out we are totally screwed. We can barely afford the payment let alone a new transmission. Please someone help us to find a way to get this crooked dealership to honor the recall and warranty, it was still under warranty when we first brought it to their attention. We are just trying to get along in this world with 3 kids and without this car we are screwed. We do not deserve to be taken for a run around!!!"
"Nov 05","2016","Fiesta SES","Transmission Failed","100,000 miles","After having the car for two years, the car just simply quit and is not covered at all since it is a transmission issue for a 2011 Ford Fiesta that has just reached 100000km. I had to replace the transmission at my expense. They would not give me a car a courtesy car, they would not even offer to have the shuttle drive me to work. I had to walk the 2km from the bus stop when the location was a five minute drive from the dealership.They would not guarantee the work even though they know that this car has transmission problems and it may have to be done again and again. Consumers of Ford produces are bleed dry when Ford is fully aware that they are offering the public a faulty product. A product which will one day cause someone to loose their life driving something that jerks, coasts, and delays shifting. Ford advertises the product as a automatic when what is repeatedly requiring replacement is a clutch.In the 35 years that I have driven cars I have never had to replace a clutch in any other automatic car. I can't empathize enough if you want a reliable car do not purchase a Ford or you as a consumer will be bleed financially for a product that they are not pulling or recalling until someone dies because of their mistake. And that my friends is a sad day for both Canadian and US consumers who purchase a Ford product."
"Dec 26","2013","Fiesta","Transmission Failed","114,905 miles","This was a huge safety concern especially on the freeway. The car was brought in 12/26/13 and was not ready until 1/15/14."
"Aug 15","2012","Fiesta SE 4","Transmission Failed","5,672 miles","In Winnipeg, entering off ramp, driving too close to the truck in front of me. Truck suddenly hits brakes and so do I. Truck moves ahead and I step on the gas, nothing happens. Put car in reverse, nothing happens. Put car in Park, can't turn off ignition. Cars behind me blowing their horns, drivers pretty angry. I discover that if you hit the brake and put transmission in Park you can shut off engine and then restart.Car then will move forward when put in Drive. A very scary situation."
"Jan 08","2016","Fiesta SE 4","Transmission Failed","127,047 miles","I purchased this car in good faith from Ford, knowing that that I drive 100 miles daily. I need reliable transportation. I have had the clutch and TCM replace a couple of times This part has failed yet again. Ford is aware that this is a design flaw; they extended the warranty to 120,000 miles. Now since my car is out to warranty and since there is a recall on the part needed; I am SOL. I still owe $10,000 on this car. Since I have put over 120,000 miles on the car all repairs are on me; okay fine whatever.Since the part is being re-tooled I have to wait for a repair ; I have been told it could take six months to a year or longer. So in the mean time I still have a car payment, I still have to pay for the insurance, I get to look at my pretty little green car sitting in my yard every day as I have to rely on other people to get to work, (Not an easy feat being 48 miles from work). I am not very happy with Ford.Other than the transmission issues I have been happy with this car. the gas mileage is great, I have been lucky with it up to this point. Ford gave me a loaner (because it was under warranty) every they needed to repair it."
"Nov 29","2015","Fiesta SE 4","Transmission Failed","61,400 miles","We purchased a 2011 Ford Fiesta in October 2015 from our neighbor, who kept meticulous care and service records on the vehicle. The vehicle was always dealer serviced and had been in for the transmission service bulletins. Within 60 days of owning the vehicle the transmission failed. The car backed out of the garage, and upon shifting to drive it would not go into gear, but the engine would rev. The car starts up just fine, but will not go into any gear.We had the car immediately towed to the local dealer. The dealer replaced the Transmission Control Module, but that did not fix the problem. The dealer now reports we need a new transmission. $6500 + tax. We have been told by both the dealer and Ford corporate that we are 1,400 miles over warranty at 61,400 miles, so there is no financial assistance with the repair. We have talked to a Ford regional service manager in Florida who repeats the same denial of assistance. This is the first Ford we have ever owned. The communication from Ford makes it clear to us that Ford does not stand behind their products. This transmission has had many service bulletins and complaints. Should we even be able to afford the new transmission, what are we to do if that one fails soon after going past the much more limited warranty (fewer years, fewer miles)? We were hopeful that Ford would want to resolve the problem with us, as Ford also has a stake in this issue with regard to product quality and how they treat customers. Unfortunately, theyâ€™ve made it clear we are on our own. We are now very discouraged. If anyone at Ford reads this and can help us, we would love to hear from you."
"Oct 01","2015","Fiesta SES","Transmission Failed","100,000 miles","I've only ever driven Ford: Ford Escort Station wagon, Ford Mustang, Ford Explorer, and now have transmission problems with a four-year old 2011 Ford Fiesta. I had the vehicle at a Ford dealership for a month. They notified us that our vehicle would not be ready for another 2 to 3 weeks because they were still waiting for a manual transmission availability. Seven weeks without a vehicle? Really? The communication initiation had been on our part since drop-off. At every contact, we were given the run around. Four weeks into the wait, we decided to not go through with the $3500 work. We were not sold quality this time, and the whole service process had been nothing but disappointing. At one point in time, Ford exemplified stellar service, and quality, however, I guarantee to NEVER buy Ford or it's other affiliates again! And you can be assured that I will express these same sentiments to all who will listen!"
"Jul 17","2015","Fiesta SES","Transmission Failed","60,000 miles","Got my 2011 Ford Fiesta SES Hatchback used in February 2013. It was a tough choice between the Honda Fit and the Fiesta, but I went with the Fiesta. God, I wish I hadn't.In June, I couldn't turn on the air at all without the car making an extremely loud whirring sound. Turns out it needed some kind of converter replaced. $600. Got my car back a week later, and on the way home from the mechanic, the car would only blow hot air. Drove it right back.Another week went by, and I finally got it back. A couple of days after that, I was pulling out of a parking lot and was sitting at a light, ready to turn left, when the rpm shot up and down several times (while my foot was on the break), the car began to shake mildly, and then the rpm finally shot down to 0. The car lost all power except for the battery. I put the car in park, shut it off, and restarted it and it turned back on."
"Feb 10","2015","Fiesta Powershift 1.6L","Transmission Failed","68,500 miles","My transmission went out. Almost no warning, it just wouldn't shift right, so I took it to the transmission specialists to find out what was wrong. When they hooked it up to the computer, they said that first, third and fifth gears were not engaging and it was starting in 2nd, shifting to 4th and then 6th gear. Reverse was still working, thankfully! However, to get it fixed, the biggest problem was that since this was such a new (relatively) vehicle, Ford is not making/selling the parts to fix it. The transmission guy said he could fix it for around $2000 IF the parts were available. But since they are not available, his only alternative was to replace the transmission. Parts (wholesale prices) would be $3900 for the new transmission (which would only be guaranteed to work 3 years) plus labor to install it for a total of $4800. I just checked and Ford is still not selling the parts, so I guess I'll have to sell it for what I can get out of it. I can't see spending another $5K to have it do this again in 3 years! I drove it around town for another 45 days or so and then another gear went out. Now it won't go above 30 miles per hour unless I'm on a downward incline. I might get it up to 38 or 40 mph, but I can't sustain that speed on level ground. I guess I lost 4th/6th gears. Anyone wanna buy this? I was gonna wait until the ""recall"" came out and Ford fixed it for free, but I'm giving up on that. lol"
"Feb 21","2015","Fiesta Powershift 1.6L","Transmission Failed","46,603 miles","Transmission chugged going from 1st to 2nd then again from 4th to 5th. Dealership said to wait till I broke down on the side of the road and they would come pick me up! So nice when you pay for that extra warranty! Then told me it wasn't a common problem. Took it to another dealership, they said it was so common the part was on back order. Turns out they put a band aid on a bigger problem. Less then 3 months later car is back for complete failure. Engine revs to 5000 rpm the second you touch the gas pedal. Now dealership is trying to say its not covered!"
"Apr 08","2013","Fiesta Powershift 1.6L","Transmission Failed","58,000 miles","We were going maybe 35mph when the transmission started making a horrible grinding noise and you couldn't go over 20 mph or it'd sound like it was going to explode. The ford dealership came and got it the next day. Luckily is was still under warranty but barely. I was 2,000 miles from being out of warranty. The ford dealership ordered parts just to find out they were on back order and they had no idea how long it was going to be before they came in. After waiting for two months I finally got my car back but it wasn't because they had received the part that was on back order. Instead they had ordered a brand new transmission and it came in before the parts did. All of this happened not too long after I had taken it up to the dealership telling them it was taking it forever to shift and them telling me everything looked fine. Needless to say, I wasn't a happy camper."
"Jun 01","2023","Outback 2.5i Limited 2.5L 4-cyl","Excessive Oil Consumption","145,000 miles","Bought a used 2013 Outback and have had to add a quart of oil about every 2,000-2,500 miles. Thankfully it alerts me when the oil level is low and I don't have to keep checking it, but it's a bit expensive over time! There's no signs of leaking anywhere, it just gets burnt off apparently."
"Mar 20","2018","Outback 2.5 Limited 4v","Excessive Oil Consumption","169,021 miles","DO NOT BUY THIS MODEL! Oh my god!!! I have to put oil in it every 350 miles and I'm still paying this car off! All the freakin lights are on in the dashboard, it currently has a P0420 code coming up and I've spent so much money on oil to keep it going. We're now on the thickest synthetic oil it can take and still nothing changes. The only solution to fix the leaking oil gasket is to get a new engine, which at this point is worth more than the car! If I stop too ""fast"" at a light or in traffic the engine will stall, if the engine doesn't stall you can feel the engine shaking while idling. I cannot wait to get rid of this car!"
"Jun 01","2014","Outback Limited 2.4L","Excessive Oil Consumption","149,600 miles","As reported by another complaint, I have to add oil at least once between oil changes. I change oil every 7,500 miles. If I go on long trips of 1,000 miles or more round trip, I have to always add a quart of oil. I have been doing this for 6 years now. I purchased the car used with only 12,500 miles in February 2013. I have just grown accustomed to checking the oil, especially before I take long trips. Usually, I'm reminded when oil light comes on and add a quart of oil. Car has never missed a manufacturer's recommended service and always serviced by Subaru dealer. Car runs great. It is just annoying.I just chalked this up to not Subaru's finest vehicle year. This was my second 2013 Subaru. The first one was totaled in an accident on a slippery snow covered road resulting in my car doing a 180 flip down a shallow ravine. all air curtains/bags deployed properly. Bluetooth was working, so I could easily dictate 911 dial up. I walked away without a scratch. That is why I purchased the same year, make, model and trim Subaru again. Sometimes you have to up with idiosyncrasies, depending what is of more value to you. In my case, an extra 4-6 quarts of oil a year..."
"Jul 02","2019","Outback 2.4L","Excessive Oil Consumption","86,000 miles","As many others have noted on this forum, this car has an oil consumption problem. I took it to Nate Wade Subaru in Salt Lake City and had this problem assessed at least six different times. The first time, I was about 3,000 miles into an oil change and the light came on. I brought it into Nate Wade and they started an oil consumption test, which I passed. The problem seemed nonexistent through the remainder of the 5,000 miles I had until the next change.I then changed my oil at home before a trip to Calgary. At almost 3,000 miles on the nose, the light comes back on. I take it to Subaru and they replace the oil sensor light and tell me that this should definitely fix the problem. They topped me off with oil and sent me on my way. Again, with no problems until the next change.I change my oil at my place once more, and again we come to the same issue on another road trip. I understand that the oil problem is exacerbated by prolonged trips in the car, but I bought this car with the intention of using it for road trips, so this is especially disappointing.I bring this issue to Nate Wade again and they say there is nothing they can do for me. They've given me the perfunctory oil consumption test and if I want to explore this issue further I should contact Subaru of America. So, I do, and they start another test. I schedule a trip to the Grand Canyon because I definitely want to fail this test and if I have been having problems on road trips, I might as well take one... I check the oil before embarking because I want to see how much it changed over the course of the trip and I am appalled. They have clearly overfilled my oil by at least a half a quart (half the distance between the full and bottom mark)."
"Jun 30","2018","Outback Premium 2.5L","Excessive Oil Consumption","98,500 miles","I bought a 2013 Subaru Outback from an Audi Dealer who advertised it on Auto Trader. I was looking for a Subaru and found it to be a good price with an extended, but limited, warranty. It was a pretty good deal and it brought my interest rate down a point which made it more or less affordable. About two weeks after I purchased it, the oil light came on. I took it back to Audi and they told me to take it to Subaru.I took it to Subaru and they did an oil consumption test which they said passed. I found out that this car had been in several times from a previous owner for the same issue. While I was there the second time, another customer was there for the same problem. I wrote letters, had a second test done, sent emails back and forth to a Subaru representative for 7 months with no avail. They told me to check my oil every time I filled up the car. I drive over 1,500 miles a month! Are you kidding me?My car requires oil topped off every 1,300 miles or less. The test's limit for oil consumption is1,200. How ironic that my vehicle runs low on oil approximately 100 miles from the the set limit imposed by a class action lawsuit. This tells me that Subaru has figured out where the threshold is on the oil running low and set it below that threshold so that most, if not all, customers doing the oil consumption test will pass it. Therefore, these cars are not being fixed by Subaru. I'm going to complain on this website, on Twitter, put a sign on my car and drive around three to five counties every month telling everyone that unbeknownst to me. I bought a defective vehicle which the manufacturer will not fix, even though several mechanics confirm the problem and say the vehicle will eventually stop working because of the piston rings being defective."
"Feb 01","2013","Outback","Excessive Oil Consumption","7,500 miles","This was me and my wifeâ€™s first brand new car we had ever purchased and we were really excited about it...we had heard nothing but great things about Subaruâ€™s and we finally felt like â€œgrown upsâ€ making what we thought was a mature and practical decision by purchasing this 2013 Subaru Outback...we have two kids and were planning to do some traveling so we researched and felt like this was our â€œgo to carâ...we also looked into a Jeep Wrangler and a Toyota 4Runner...our main goal was to have a car that could go 300k and build life memories with our kids along the way...after our first free oil change (our outback came with like 2 yrs free oil change or 24k or something like that) we noticed the oil light came on almost a week after it was done. My wife called the dealership and they told her oil burn off was normal and it wasnâ€™t a big deal. So we added a qt or two in and have done so every since for the last almost 6 yrs. We got notices for other recalls but never for the oil consumption issue, now our car needs a little tlc and maintenance so I was looking around online to figure out some of those issues along with inquiring about this oil consumption issue and read other owners were complaining about it and thatâ€™s how I found out that Subaru had a class action law suit back in 2016 where they were fixing this issue and we were never notified by them or the dealership that sold us the car...now we are over our warranty mileage...they did offer to do the oil consumption test, but wouldnâ€™t go any further, Iâ€™m hoping they will do right by us, but Iâ€™m not really sure theyâ€™ll show us the â€œLOVEâ€...for the last 6 yrs I have bought countless quarts of oil and have wished we had gotten the 4Runner or Wrangler ever since...pretty sure we will never purchase another Subaru again...darn shame too, because on paper they seem like the â€œgo toâ€ car that canâ€™t be beat, but in reality Iâ€™m not sure anyone should spend their hard earned money on this brand any longer...their marketing department fooled us 6 yrs ago, but I wonâ€™t fall for it again...Iâ€™ll be looking into vehicles with real long lasting ability and a track record to prove it, not just some marketing campaign with cute dogs and lgbtq ad manipulation...Iâ€™m writing this on 12/12/2018 and the outback is at the dealership getting the oil consumption test done as I type...I won even get into the bs of the technician trying to up sale me to get me to pay for a light bulb replacement for a light that wasnâ€™t out while getting the air bag and windshield wiper motor recalled fixed...or the fact that the radiator went out right after our two yr warranty ended...I definitely donâ€™t get the loyal brand following on this thing...I really wanted to â€œLOVEâ€ this outback too...I was planning on upgrading to the new ascent, but will definitely be looking at the Grand Cherokee or 4Runner now...really bummed out"
"Nov 03","2018","Outback 2.5i","Excessive Oil Consumption","45,500 miles","I can't believe I already experienced two engine issues in last 5 years. I bought this car as a new one and bought 3 years service package from the dealer and did all maintenance services for the engine as Subaru recommendation. Last year, it had an issue with coolant leaking into engine when I did regular maintenance service at the dealer. But it is still under 5 years / 60k mileage warranty. So it got covered.Now just 5 months after passing 60 months warranty period but it is still only under 50k mileage, dealer found out oil leak because of cam carrier problem. This car was never used for off-road and even not for long trips. It was used only as a commuter car from/to work. I am so pissed off about unreliable engine seal system. Any suggestions about should I keep this car or sell it. I am really worried it might have another oil leak or gasket problems even after I fix current problem at the dealer."
"Jun 04","2015","Outback 2.5i Premium 4 cyl","Excessive Oil Consumption","120,000 miles","I purchased my 2013 Outback in August 2012 from IRA Subaru in Danvers, MA. My first issue was around 65000 miles when my oil light came on. I checked the oil and it was down a quart but I still had 1500 miles before I was due for an oil change. I talked to the Dealer - the book said change oil every 7500 miles, but the Dealer said it depended on how you drive and where I put a lot of mileage on my car, it was recommended changing the oil every 6000 miles. So that sounded like a Plan!It got progressively worse and by 92000 miles I was adding 3/4 qts of oil per oil change. It was recommended that I have an oil consumption test done, but I was also told in order to Fail the OCT the car had to be going through a qt of oil every 1200 miles. I knew at the time I wouldn't fail the test, so I put it off. I had purchased the 100,000 mile extended warranty when I bought the car and was concerned the warranty would expire before I officially Failed the OCT. But I was told by the Dealer (Twin City Subaru Berlin, VT) that it shouldn't matter because we identified the problem while still under the Extended Warranty. Finally at 107,000 miles I was confident I would Fail the test and had it done. And it Failed! Then I was told by the same Dealer that where it was now past 100,000 miles mark, Subaru Would Not cover any repairs!! The Dealer gave me the phone number to talk to Subaru directly and they told me the same thing.The car now has 120,000 miles and I am adding 1 qt every 500/600 miles, how ridiculous is that? I just finished paying for the car this fall and what is a car like this worth now that its paid for? Who would ever purchase a car burning this much oil? That Subaru will not stand behind their product, to me, is criminal!!We are a 2 Subaru Outback family (my wife has a 2015 Outback) - Soon to Be a Zero Subaru Family!! It is definitely the ""Last Subaru"" we will ever own."
"Aug 03","2016","Outback 2.5L","Excessive Oil Consumption","20,724 miles","In June 2016, I bought a 2013 Outback 2.5L with 19,224 miles from a Subaru dealership about 33 miles from my home town. I paid extra for Certified pre-owned status. I thought it was a good deal since it had low miles, and the dealership told me the previous owners were an older couple who only averaged 5600 miles a year.Of course, about a month or so (1500 miles) later the oil light came on. I had to stop at a gas station and put a quart in. I knew this wasn't right since the dealer told me they just did an oil change and that I wouldn't have to add or change the oil for another 6500 miles. I did some investigation and learned about the class action lawsuit related to high oil consumption for many Subaru models, including my own.Next time I took it in to my local dealer, I asked for an oil consumption test. They did an oil change, filled the oil and told me to bring it back after I'd driven it 1200 - 1500 miles. I did so (closer to 1500 miles), and they found that it burned twice the amount of oil they expected. They said because my car was still under warranty, they were going to replace the engine block, which they did in January 2017.It did not cost me anything except the pain and aggravation of being misled by the original dealership which knew this model and year were included in the class action lawsuit, but still sold it to me at a typically elevated dealership price without disclosing the issue. Additionally I'm now in possession of a car which had the engine block replaced at 24,000 miles, which very likely will reduce the value and make it more difficult for me to sell on the private market or to trade it in for a reasonable amount."
"Apr 29","2016","Outback 2.5L","Excessive Oil Consumption","123,058 miles","I am retired ,not much money, and just made 1st payment on 2013 Subaru outback to find out the oil consumption is outrageous and would like to know if there has been any recalls to fix problem????ðŸ˜£ðŸ˜£ðŸ˜£"
"Apr 01","2016","Outback Premium 2.5L","Excessive Oil Consumption","12,400 miles","this vehicle has been serviced by subaru - Oil consumption test. we were informed that the oil consumption was with specs of normal consumption . this can be verified by Records.Every 500 miles the yellow oil light comes on and requires .5 (half quart) of oil."
"Oct 30","2015","Outback Premium 2.5L","Excessive Oil Consumption","112,000 miles","In the last 12 months or so, My outback has been burning a lot of oil. I have to add at least one quart during every 7500 mile change interval. In the past few months, it seems to have gotten worse. I recently added a quart, then a few weeks later, another quart, and now its time to change the oil. WTF? $20 for two quarts of synthetic oil, and now another $80 for the regular oil change? Killing me! I drive a lot, but now I'm thinking of getting rid of the car because more and more issues are starting to crop up. Anyone else have similar experiences once mileage starts to creep up?"

"Aug 14","2013","Outback","Excessive Oil Consumption","4,300 miles","I bought this Subaru new and the dealer Doyle Subaru/Chevolet in Webster,New York is just playing games until it comes out from under the 100,000 mile warranty or reaches 5 years which ever comes first. I have to carry oil with me as I never know when the oil pressure light will come on and I will have to add oil. I must check it regularly before I start on a trip or plan to drive more than 30 miles. It drops 2 quarts or more. The last time it went in to the dealership, they messed with the oil pressure light so it will not come on. That means a very regular check of the oil on my part. I have a local garage keeping records on the car as I get the dealer to do the oil changes under their warranty. This is Subaru #9 in our family. All were Outbacks but two Legacies and we never had oil usage problems with any of them. We take them off the road at about 275,000 miles and expect them to last. This 2013 has 61,453 miles on it and it is called on to travel around New York State, Pa and Ohio hauling a load of show rabbits to different show locals. I do not expect that I will keep it much beyond 100,000 miles unless Subaru steps up and admits that they have a problem and solves it. Will there be Subaru #10??? That will depend on how they solve the problems with #9 over the next 3 years. If they can not then I will dump the vehicle and look at another brand. I do not trust the dealer and that is why I have an independent garage watching the oil usage and keeping records on it. Then is needed I can sue Subaru for any repairs needed on the engine"
"May 15","2015","Outback Premium 2.5L","Excessive Oil Consumption","70,000 miles","My beef is that when I bought this car, Subaru already knew they had an issue. Once the problem was brought to their attention I was 10k out of warranty. Subaru of America did exactly nothing to help. NO LOVE there! Love is a one way street from my dealings with Subaru of America. Shameful. Extended Warranty company has put in a used Junk yard motor that Subaru of America calls re manufactured I have had it two weeks and have burnt thru almost all of my oil. Their ""re-manufactured"" is worse than the original one. I am into this repair for over 500 dollars, multiple visits to the dealer, over a month of not having my car. My recommendation to anyone that asks, is to steer clear of this disaster. I cannot tell you how many hours on the phone with Subaru along with missed time from work. Very bad feelings. Used to feel good when I saw other Soobs driving by, now I feel bad for those owners. I just want to get this rolling piece of junk fixed so I can trade it in for a different manufacturer. It has been a summer of Subaru! NOT a Subaru summer! Buyers beware!"
"Jun 01","2015","Outback 2.5I 2.5L","Excessive Oil Consumption","35,000 miles","Purchased two Subaru Outbacks (2013 and 2014). The 2013 had the check engine oil light at 35,000 miles. Added 1 qt and took the car into the dealer for an oil consumption test. Dealership recommends that you return after driving 1,000-1,200 miles. However, the oil level indicated a 50% overfill when the oil change occurred. Because of this, I did not return for the first consumption test, but monitored at home. Level dropped to empty at 3,000-3,500 miles. When back to the dealer for a repeat of the consumption test. Again, the oil level was overfilled by 50%. Talked to the service manager, who explained this was the result of oil from elsewhere int the engine settling with time. However, I checked both after driving and a few hours after rest and level was unchanged. With previous vehicles and previous oil change services, the technicians always showed the dipstick level at full following the change, to indicate to me the amount added was appropriate.The salesperson at the dealership acknowledged the 2013 Outbacks had piston rings that were manufactured below specifications, but the bar repair is high. I am having a difficult time trusting the dealership after two deceptive services. I purchased both Outbacks with the intention of making them 10yr cars, but the excessive oil consumption concerns me for engine longevity. There are two pending class action lawsuits regarding this oil consumption problem, a problem that Subaru will not acknowledge.Will never consider the purchase of a Subaru in the future. Have talked many friends and family out of purchasing this brand." 
"Aug 11","2015","Outback 3.6L","Excessive Oil Consumption","51,000 miles","We brought in the Subaru Outback every 4k miles for an oil change as scheduled by the dealer. Yes we know synthetic oil lasts longer but..... anyway, after all the free oil changes we started to change the oil ourselves. Then checking the oil, water, etc... and found the car was needing a qt added, so we took it to another dealer for an oil change and had them check the oil before the car went away. It was 1/2 qt low and of course filled to the correct level when we picked it up. Adding more oil before the next oil change I googled oil consumption and from there we went to our regular dealer and the oil consumption test started.At 1200 miles we were a bit under a 1/3 qt low. I video taped the crappy service rep as he looked at the dip stick. Hope we were the final nail in his dismissal letter. Anyway, we went in and another rep told him the 1/3 warranted an engine block to be ordered and no more consumption tests. I waited a week before calling about an update on the block. It had never been ordered. Spoke to the service manager and he said the test was completed. I told him to look at the first line of the test that said if it was this low, order a block. I also told him that the level, 250 miles later, was at the middle dot in the dip stick and I could hear the valves knocking. I also told him the twit never added oil to bring the level back up. But if he wanted me to drive the car until the thing blew up, say so...you are being recorded. Short tale is: Bring the car back, here is a loaner Forrester to drive for 2-3 weeks while the car is repaired.I also mentione o the service manager that the 3.6 is not the normal complaint for this, it's the 2.5 (?) and he said correct. Wonder how many 3.6 engine owners have their oil changed frequently and never realized their engine problem until it is out of warranty. We have never heard a more a$$nine statement than ""it's normal oil consumption"" when our 16 year old Durango has never consumed a drop between oil changes.I'm going to monitor other sites to see if I can find another 3.6 report of a problem."
"Jun 15","2013","Outback 2.5L","Excessive Oil Consumption","15,003 miles","My wife wanted the Outback. When I was a mechanic you could always tell a Subaru was coming due to a common part failure which caused the car to make a distinctive sound. Well when I looked at the car and drove it I was impressed. Not after the second oil change. Every three thousand miles I need to add a quart.I called the dealer who informed me this was within tolerance. I told him my F150 goes 10k between oil changes and does not use a drop of oil. I could have the dealer do an oil change and then bring it in every 500 miles for them to check. If the consumption was to great they had a fix which sounds more like a band aid.The car now has 65K as my wife does a lot of driving. Just replaced the original tires at 55k. Rotated every 7500 miles. Going to change plugs at 67k and front pads.Well we will not be buying another Subaru as I feel the oil consumption is unacceptable. It is not like they just started building this engine. Oh it also sounds like marbles when I drive it near a wall or divider. I am using regular gas as the owners manual indicates and the car sounds like it is pinging."
"Oct 01","2014","Outback","Excessive Oil Consumption","30,000 miles","First and last Subaru. Found out the hard way the engine burns oil. Subaru tried to tell me it is normal consumption to burn 1/3 quart of oil per 1200 miles, that would mean that you could be adding  just under 2 quarts of oil in between oil changes and it would be considered normal. We have had a pleasant experience with the dealerships up until the moment I brought up the oil loss. Then I was stone walled when requesting information and have been treated like a leper ever since. The best thing you can do is trade your car in for a loss, the next best thing is let them replace the engine block on your brand new car (it will never run the same, I also have read that the problem persists even after this fix). The worst possible outcome is if it consumes just under the limit set by Subaru that you can't get the problem fixed, but you get to feed oil into your car, so that once it is out of warranty you get to start replacing O2 sensors, spark plugs, and catalytic converters like band aids. Not to mention the dirty combustion chambers and fouled valve seats and the decreased gas mileage.I talked my wife into buying this car, told her it was a 300,000 mile car...It will need a new engine block after 40,000 miles, and this is common."
"Jul 31","2014","Outback 4 Door Wagon 2.5L I","Excessive Oil Consumption","37,527 miles","Took my car in for 'oil consumption test'. The car had been driven 1157 miles since the last oil change, and had consumed 0.4 quarts of oil. I was told that the oil consumption was ""good news-well within specifications"". Also was told that the oil consumption test had to be done ONLY at 1200 miles, and since I will be taking it on a 3000 mile trip next week, it will have to be started over when I return. I asked if I could have it done at other dealerships along the way, and was told ""No. The same technician has to do it each time."" I asked for a copy of the test, and refused to leave until they gave it to me. It is unsigned and I intend to go back this morning and ask the service manager (Josh Frick, Tom Woods Subaru, Indianapolis, Indiana) to sign it. Wish me luck on that one.Nevertheless, they mislead me on the following (from the hard copy of the Consolidated Engine Oil Consumption Test):1. There is nothing that states that it has to be done at exactly 1200 miles. In fact there is a very specific set of instructions on how to calculate any mileage, thus converting it to 1200 miles. The story about having to start the test over every time we don't get it there at the right time is untrue.2. There is nothing about the same technician or dealership having to do the oil consumption test.3. By their specifications, we failed the test.I have contacted BBB, Angies List, and WISH TV investigative reporters about this. Since we live just south of the factory where this beast was manufactured (Lafayette, IN.) I don't think we are going to get any local support.The factory and the dealership make a big deal about being ""green"", yet the cars they manufacture are burning a lot of oil. What is the chemical content of synthetic oil burning? I ask because one of my grandsons gets carsick in this car, and does not in our Honda. Can somebody help us?"

Or I could buy a Cherokee w/ 200K miles and in relatively good shape, $2000. Guess what I went with. Minis are a blast when they run, they'll do about 139 with a light headwind and handle like a go-cart. The electrical system is overly complicated and nothing but problems. In the old days (the before times, the long-long-ago) I could fix electrical problems with a good multimeter and wire stripper. Now if anything goes wrong, I have to take it to some asshole dealer. My advice, don't buy anything where the electrical system requires more than 1 ECU or relies on a CANbus. Unless you have a really hot warranty or can afford to drop minimum $1500 on a repair bill, you're screwed."

"Mar 11","2010","Silverado LT 5.3L","Knocking Noise From Engine","130,000 miles","The engine started knocking and has progressively gotten worse. I have read some of the other complaints and I believe it is due to the oil pump or something along that line. I say this because as this first began I could start my truck and there would be NO Noise. After about 20 seconds it would sound like the lifters had pumped down and were out of oil. Then about another 10 seconds and they would pump back up. Now they are getting louder and it not only starts as soon as you start the truck, it is louder. I have owned Chevrolet vehicles for probably 35 years and this will be the last. It really pisses me off when a company knows there is a problem and will not fix it. Two other problems that I know many folks have had is the passenger window motor going out and the rear brakes as well. I rarely ever used my passenger window and had to have it replaced. Additionally, I had used my emergency brakes only 3 or 4 times and the back brakes went out. They said it was from lack of use. Come on!"

My fix; complete rebuild. I read a ton of forums discussing this problem and most thoughts were piston slap or low oil pressure. When i checked the clearances after 200,000 miles: the cylinder's were not even 0.001"" out of spec, piston slap is not the issue. The rebuild got all new pistons, new bearings, bored over cylinders. The low oil pressure? I did have poor oil pressure when I bought the truck, something like 45-50PSi hot and the pressure would get higher as the truck warmed up which to this day baffles me. To correct the oil pressure during the rebuild I put a high volume SLP camaro oil pump in. Now 80PSi cold and 60PSi hot idle. After the rebuild, not a lick of knock. I bought the truck with 167,000miles on it so i thought nothing of the issue, until my 2004 5.3l just started doing it at 145,000 as well... now I am confident its an issue related specifically to the LS based Vortec family of engines."

I will try and sell this car as soon I get it running again. I started getting a warning oil light that went off when the car was above 1200 rpms. I checked oil for level, it was fine. I kept driving, after about two weeks, the warning light stayed on non stop after the car warmed up. On the last day, it started making noised under the hood, I have parked it, until I am able to take the timing chain and water pump off to inspect the oil pump. I am hoping to have it running again in a few weeks. Then it goes up for sale.",""

Was told that engine sludge was the case and was told that I caught the problem in the nick of time. Engine head was cleaned and oil was replaced. Soon after the noise started again and I took the car back in only to hear that due to lack of maintenance I was unable to receive a new engine under warranty, even though they just replaced my oil and cleaned the engine... Just in the nick of time they said? So I got the engine replaced by a friend at a small mechanic shop up North, same model engine with about 33,000 miles. Again the engine began to knock and was told that it too was ruined. Now I will be getting my third engine in hopes that I can get it to the dealership in time to trade it before it starts knocking too.",

I asked if they wanted me to drive the car with knocking noise until friday she said yea if it breaks down we'll have it towed. next day the noise was worse I drove the car to Arrigo Dodge (just barely) I couldn't drive it into the service lane it was that bad. I was given a rental. to make a long story short after 1 week with my my car and several messages later. I was told that my extended warranty was not honored because sludge was found and that was due to lack of maintenance. produced reciepts and I was told they have to have oil tested at their lab. almost 2 weeks later and several phone calls later i was told the test came back contaminated and this was due to lack of maintanece. the car is presently at Arrigo Dodge and has been since 11/24/04. I still owe $20,000+ on the car the car will be repossessed because I cant't afford to pay for something that is not doing me any good.

I was able to get the temporary fix of bypassing the fuel pump relay finally and that fixed the starting problem. This is just a patch, not a permanent fix per the guy that sells them.

Dodge wants to replace fuel pump first before they will consider a new TIPM. I will buy a replacement TIPM and by pass Dodge installing it myself.

Was able to track down that the TIPM had faulty relays that were not shutting down. Now the fuel pump runs non stop (must pull battery cable to keep battery from going dead). The horn relay and fuel pump relays are stuck and can not be replaced separately. From what I see online cost is about $1200 - 1500 to repair.

"Aug 23","2024","Town & Country Limited 3.2L V6","TIPM Failure. Would Not Start","180,000 miles","Replaced the alternator only to have the battery be drained and that was a new battery.

Called my son to jump start my car for me so he. The car ran for 5 min. and quit. Would not start again even after jump starting. Next day had to flat bed to mechanic. Mechanic said was alternator. Update from Sep 25, 2024 My dad looked online and saw a way that we could reset the TIPM. We tried that and the vehicle worked. We used the vehicle for 5 days with out any problems. Now yesterday the vehicle would not start again. On Sunday my husband used the lift gate and also we took our granddaughter to church and she was buckled in the back seat. I am unsure if one of those caused the battery to draw done again. The vehicle worked Monday morning. I drove it for 10 minutes that day; then it set for the rest of the day. I know that it takes awhile for the battery to drain so I believe that is why it did not start yesterday. My son said I should undo the negative cable every night and re-connect in the morning. I do not believe I should have to do that, I have filed several complaints with Chrysler to no avail. Then I see that there was a lawsuit filed against them on this issue. Why were not all the people notified, This is the second Town and Country I have owned. The first one I had I never had a problem with that is why i bought another one. I do not believe I will purchase another one not after all the headaches with this one. These past few months alone I have spent over 2500.00 on this vehicle.

I am the primary driver of the van, about Aug. 2015 we started to have issues with the van having intermittent electrical issues. We had the battery replaced & the alternator was tested; it tested good. The problems seemed to have resolved themselves. Then it started having intermitten issues again at the end of Oct. beg. Nov.; the biggest of these intermitten issues(both times was not starting). We took it to have the code(s) read to see if it was throwing a code. However, the checks always came back the same, ""No codes"". Then as the problem progressed the van stalled on me in the middle of a 45mph road, as I was stopped at a red light with my kids in the car. Then a few days to a week later it stalled on me in my neighborhood going 10mph, I was barely able to coast it to the side of the road & eventually get it to restart. About a week later it went from every few days to a week or so of going out to take my kids to school & not being able to start my van, to it being an everyday issue & being harder & harder to get it to start or stay started once it would finally start. We took it to our dealership, about 12/5/15 to leave it there until they repaired the van. At that point I did not feel that my van was safe for daily commuting. The dealership proceeded to tell me that it was my fuel pump, I kindly disagreed & told them that it was the TIPM but they could go ahead & replace the fuel pump but they were going to ensure that my van was 100% fixed & safe before they gave it back to me. They called a few days later & informed me that it was indeed the TIPM & they would need to order a new one. It was replaced & reprogrammed on 12/15/15.I actually purchased the Van in August of 2014, not June."

Once vehicle got to the dealership they kept it to diagnose, called us following day and told us they would need to replace the fuel pump at a total cost of $843.They called on Saturday, September 1st to let us know it was ready for pick up, got to the dealership and started the vehicle up and the same problem persisted as to when we dropped it off in the first place. Today, September 4th we received a call from the dealership saying that they placed our original fuel pump back into the vehicle and diagnosed it with a TIPM failure, the cost will increase to $1,111.00. The vehicle is supposed to be completed tomorrow. My main concern is that many Chrysler products have had TIPM issues, why hasn't this been recalled??Other Chrysler products that are 2011's, but not Town and Country's, have been recalled for this issue, why has this petition been denied. I really wish more people would do their due diligence and report these things, it could save many of us this hassle and also save the consumers money....and most importantly, make Chrysler stand behind their product!!"

Then they told us it was a crankshaft sensor so we had that replaced and still had the same issue. Finally they figured out it was a faulty fuel relay and our van was good. We spent over $5,000 resolving this issue and it would have been $1100 more if we had replaced the TIPM instead of just bypassing it!"

It has been at least two consecutive and maybe three times that I have had oil changes at this Kia dealership. I was told that there was very little oil left in the motor. I was confused as this was the first time I have heard this and I have used Good year, Firestone and a couple of other local shops service the car previously. The vehicle was making rattling noises coming from the engine shortly after getting an oil change so I took it back to the dealership shop. The service Advisor tells me that I'm low on oil. I said, how could I be low on oil when I had it serviced here at this shop?"

They said everything checked out an sent me on my way. We noticed immediately one of the head lights was out, but my husband fixes those no problem, so we didn't pay it any mind. It was Christmas weekend so we didn't do much besides drive a few miles to the store, so the car mostly sat until Christmas Eve. He were headed to see family, not to far maybe 15 miles at most. We noticed the engine making noises that didn't sound great but thought we would at least make it through the day. NOPE! Engine completely friggin died. There we were on the side of the road 3 kids in the car at 10PM on Christmas Eve. Kia has had my car now for 24 hours and I haven't heard a word."

"Jul 30","2016","Sorento SXL 3.3L V6 Awd","Engine Blown","59,506 miles","I was driving my vehicle to Amarillo,TX and the trip is about 100 miles from where I live. Shortly after I left home my A/C stopped working and would only blow warm air, I had an appointment the following week to get the 60,000 mile service, so I just added to the things they would have to look at because it was working intermittently prior to that. About 55 miles into the trip while my cruise control was set my vehicle started losing power, there was no warning lights or indicator that there was a problem. I pulled over to the side of the highway and noticed smoke coming out of the hood. I wasn't in a town and it was 95 degrees outside. While on the phone with Kia roadside assistance a state trooper pulled up behind me, roadside assistance told me that it would be 90 minutes to get a tow truck to me and at that time the state trooper told me he could have one there in 20 minutes, so instead of waiting on the side of the road for 90 minutes I let the trooper get a tow for me. The vehicle was towed to the same dealer that I bought it from, this happened on a Saturday, so they couldn't look at it until Monday. Kia did not have a loaner vehicle and since I was stranded and due to the time, I had to rent a vehicle from the airport, which was $300 a week. Monday they called and told me that it would need a new engine and they had to see if Kia would cover it, 5 days later they said they would cover it, but in the meantime I am still having to pay for a rental. My car was towed there on 30 Jul and was not finished until 24 Aug. It is now 7 Sep and I am still waiting on a decision from Kia to reimburse me for the tow and rental expenses. I was told that Kia would reimburse $25 a day if I rent a non Kia vehicle and $35 a day if I rent a Kia, I did not find a rental for less than $50 a day. I live in a small town, the closest rental agency is 30 miles away and there is only one agency in the area, so I'm lucky if they even have a car available, let alone it being a Kia. I have more I can say but I think people can get the picture. I loved my car, but after my experience with how they do business I will never buy a Kia again."
"Apr 29","2016","Sorento","Engine Blown","13,500 miles","Kia has yet to say that they will honor the warranty. My husband changed the oil and they are trying to determine if my husband put some other substance in the car. He has been changing oil for 50 years - I think he knows what he is doing. We are still waiting for an answer but after reading the four other comments about blown engines, I am not too optimistic. They have said it is an $8000.00 repair!!! They have given me a free loaner though."
"Dec 10","2015","Sorento","Engine Blown","30,000 miles","I purchased the Kia Sorento new June 2013. I had my first oil change at the dealer at about 5700 miles on or about November 2013. The dealer told us that Kia had the best warranty and only suggested oil changes at 7500-10,000 mile intervals. I purchased the oil and my father changed the oil 2 more times once in July 2014 and again September 2015. This vehicle was purchased for my wife who gave birth to our son three days after purchasing the vehicle. It was not driven often because she did not return to work until October 2013. As a teacher she only worked until May 2014 and did not return to work until September 2015. She worked less than 10 miles from home therefore our mileage was low. Around December 10, 2015 my wife said the car was â€œacting funnyâ€. I told her to come home and I would have my dad look at it. When she came home the car appeared fine no lights, no warnings, no sounds that wasnâ€™t normal. The next day we were driving and the car it just stopped on the side of the road. We had it towed to the dealership. The dealer took several days to tell us that the engine was blown because we didnâ€™t change the oil enough. We were not due for another oil change for 5000 miles. After a month of waiting Kia told me they were not fixing under warranty. I have spoke to many people, dealerships, junk yards, mechanics... all say after only 30000 on the car no way it should have that much engine sludge to blow the engine even IF it was never changed. (But it was I am not an idiot I know a car needs oil changes this isn't my first car and I wasn't born yesterday!!!!!)"

I drive the Massachusetts turnpike everyday and everyday it happens 3-4 times! They need to do something before someone ends up killed.

When the person in back of me passed me, he was staring. I'm assuming the violent shaking was clearly visible to others. This vehicle is a month old w/1000 miles, so I called the dealer, but there was no recall. If there is nothing visibly out of order there is nothing they can do.

"Jul 22","2016","Wrangler Rubicon Pentastar","Head Has To Be Replaced","55,000 miles","45 days now in the dealership with a blown engine. According to case manager at Chrysler its not uncommon for the ""power train"" dept as she called it, to ask for multiple photos and samples of oil, etc to make sure its not a neglect issue or other, and that can take weeks back and forth with the dealership. I thought was such bs but after all this im semi-happy now that they are giving me a new engine(although not too happy). The initial problem was misfire in cylinder 2. The service rep calls me later after the diagnostic and tells me my engine is blown and has lost compression.WOW! only 55k and its blown? Ok so although that sucks i had some hope as I bought the jeep new with the Lifetime power train warranty and a Mopar added Careplus service warranty. I dont know how that all played out into them getting me a new engine.I did however contact Chrysler alot and was even about to have an attorney who is family (no cost) to write them a letter that we would pursue legal action with a DTPA especially since alot of the dealerships apparantley knew about the issue yet kept the jeeps on the lot instead of doing the right thing and fixing it then and there. Seems like they are selling them to get numbers up and then dealing with the problem later. looks good on paper until the customer comes back and is pissed to find out that its a known issue and also jump through all the hoops to get the repair approvedand WAIT 45 days and more with no loaner no rental for a chrysler derived issue.So im waiting for the engine to get to the dealership still and from there it takes a week, which will likely be more because we all know how that goes.My thing is this, the defective head is a KNOWN problem for Chrysler and anyone experiencing the issue should have it replaced promptly and be put in a rental instead of having to wait over 40 days.Im not too sure how long anyone else has taken but this is my experience.After all it is a manufacturing issue or design flaw or who knows but its not the owners fault.Hope this gave some hope and maybe you can cite this to try and get a new engine also. After all who knows how much damage the defective head caused to the rest of the engine.-Raymond Estrada"

There was someone behind me. Luckily he wasn't distracted and was able to brake in time and get into another lane. I was very lucky - there could have been a major crash. I was also lucky I did not have a heart attack."
"Feb 18","2016","Wrangler Unlimited 3.6L V6","Head Has To Be Replaced","23,673 miles","I purchased my jeep wrangler in 2012 brand new . My first new vehicle ever. It is a right hand right jeep Gecko Green awesome color . I was so in love. I am a rural route mail carrier in Iowa. It made my job so much easier. WELL at 23,673 miles the engine light came on . I was very concerned so to the dealership we went. AND a new head was going to have to be replaced. # 6, # 2 , # 4 cylinder was misfiring. Code P0306 was found. I entered the dealership on 2/6/13 and did not get mt jeep back until 3/19/13 WOW 51 days later. Then as time went on all of my idiot lights came on, the traction light, engine light several others. My wiring harness needed to be replaced again and again with a total of 4 times. The real reason WHY was never explained to me. I was told once that a mouse got on my engine and chewed on the wire. I said REALLY, I think that the mouse walks on two legs and carries a wrench. I was working six day a week at that time No way in heck that mouse had any time to do that. A LIE . One of many that I am receiving from this dealership . So after many times returning to this dealership that problem was fixed FINALLY!!! So before the jeep reached 100,000 miles I thought I should get a extended warranty on the jeep and Chrysler would not even consider me for any warranty. If I wanted a warranty it was going to cost me around $4,000 to $5,000. I called Chrysler Service Department and got a case number and the battle was on . After weeks of discussion I received 3 warranties, engine, transmission, and electrical, four years unlimited miles. I thought GREAT! So now I have had my jeep for four years I have 148,540 miles now the jeep . I have a head problem again. I get my jeep serviced every 3,000 miles give or take a few. I believe in preventive maintenance and that did not help. So the jeep is back into the dealership again. It has been in there for 8 days now . Went in on 2/12/2106 at 3:30 as of 2/19/2016 a inspector showed up to look at the head but it was not the way he wanted it - to be able to take pictures of it -so I am waiting again . I am now doing a lot of research on this problem. Let me added that before the jeep- I drove a 1989 bronco II for 3 years with over 100,000 when I purchased it and NEVER had a engine issue. Then I purchased a 1996 GMC jimmy with over a 100,000 miles and NEVER had engine problem and drove that until transmision went out at 206,000 miles. Then I purchased a 2000 pretty blue Chevy Blazer with 27,000 miles and still driving it on mail route today at 185,000 and NEVER had the any troubles with the engine. UNBELIEVABLE 16 years !!! ALL of the miles on the blazer are mail route miles. I never had another vehicle drive. SO WHY I am having to replace TWO heads on A 2012 Jeep ???? So if any one out there can explain WHY- to me- PLEASE do. I need some advise on what I should do about this . I am still making a $563.00 a month payment on a very unreliable vehicle. I purchased a brand new vehicle to be dependable and it is not- at all. Down time kills me. At least I fought for a warranty and it is not completely coming out of my pocket. But what I want is a dependable vehicle."

Once I parked in ""Service"" (at 3:30) the female service writer would not come out, so I went in and explained that I had gone to get gas and the ""engine"" light came on. She said this may occur due to the gas cap. I then clarified that I had not yet put gas in the vehicle. I was basically asked to return the following day, so I made an appointment. Dropped of the vehicle by 0730 hours. One hour later a different female service writer let me know that a Cylinder Head needed to be replaced. I was told this would take about two days, so I opted to leave it for the repair. I was then provided a ride home, without an offer for a rental."

Even with that, the oil lamp was lighting up when I was on the AC Expressway or the NJ Turnpike near New York or I95 down south. I could never be certain that I wouldn't be stranded due to the oil problem. I even had the test done twice. It was the piston which eroded all the more as the years went by. I was in touch with Subaru at all levels of the organization. I was also a loyal Subaru customer- this being my 3rd or 4th Subaru. Well, sadly for Subaru, instead of my continued praises, it is getting my warning. The 2014 Forester is a disaster where oil is concerned.

After we got the car we realized that it was not very sound proof and that road and wind noise was more than we expected. In addition, we paid a hefty sum for the navigation system that we quit using because it sent us to strange places, sometimes on the other side of town. It also did not have major highways shown on the map. Too often it showed us driving through uncharted land. When my daughter stopped by and told me she had an engine oil light on, I checked her oil and it was down 1 quart. I told her she needed to check it out with the Subaru dealer. The next day I received the letter in the mail about the class action lawsuit on the poorly designed motor. I read the letter that claimed Subaru knew of the design defect in their motors and, essentially they would be punished if the judge accepted the settlement. That is essentially, they will extend the warranty on motor, etc. on effected cars to 100,000. Sounds fair, but unfortunately, the definition and determination was to be left up to the dealers to follow Subaru Guidelines if they wanted to be paid for work. In jest, I told my wife that they will be doing oil consumption tests and will be overfilling the oil. So, I asked my daughter to stop by after the dealer said she needed to do an oil consumption test - and they changed the oil. She stopped by - what do you think I found after 4-5 checks of oil level. The oil was overfilled by a little more than 1/2 quart. Obviously, when she returned to the dealership after 2000 miles (or was it 1500) she was told that its oil consumption was not a problem.

A chip in the windshield had happened a few days before our trip, so we decided to have the chip fixed upon our return. We turned the keys over to the dealership for the maintenance and an hour later, they returned it to us with the long crack across the windshield.

While trying to find someone who had a replacement for this car (supposedly on backorder and not available), a second crack started to the right of the first and also has made a 90 degree turn. The dealership states there are no recalls or issues. It is around $400 to replace the windshield, but then was told it was also cost $$$$ to have the side and rear camera functionality recalibrated. My insurance has a $500 deductible and therefore all of this will be out of pocket. I have never ever had this happen to any cars I've ever owned, especially when it is just sitting in a driveway. The dealership mentioned weather changes and or possibly something falling from a tree, but if this is the case, it seems like a super sensitive windshield that would not be very safe should I ever become involved in a crash.

Initial damage (see photo series) was two unsightly but repairable craters in the outer layer of glass. Within minutes / before an epoxy repair was possible, two cracks grew at an alarming rate. A smaller crack went vertically, and a fast and large crack ran horizontally. Within a day it spanned the entire driverâ€™s side. The crack reflects and refracts light into the driverâ€™s eyes, and is thick enough to obstruct vision even in dim light. Our primary travel is east in the morning and west at night, so the obstruction of vision is an active danger as we are typically oriented on the sun."

The oil lift tube has a screen in it that had become restricted with the crystalized particles (sludge?) of oil. Poor design only gives approx 2.5 square inches of screen to pass through. Anyway, we removed the pump and lift tube. I went ahead and replaced the pump since I was in there. The lift tube was let soak in carb. cleaning solution, then cleaned.

A week later they had a clutch when originally they said it would be 3 months.What also happened during this 6 month fiasco was the gas mileage kept on getting worse from averaging 7.8 to 9.1 litres per 100 kms. It was good for 6 months and then started to act up a bit and ever since then (now March 2018) it has gotten to the point as to where it was the 3rd time I brought it in the first time. It is worse when it is driven for a while and it usually is my wife who drives with me a bit on the weekend. Two weekends ago I drove the Focus for approximately 100 kms and as the day went on (shopping at different malls) the shuttering got worse to the point when we left a corner it would shutter convulsively for 50 yards or more.

I used my own check engine device and I get engine misfire codes. I was thinking it could be a bad spark plug. I called the dealer and he asked me to bring it over to check. The nearest dealer was 100 miles away, so I towed there and waited for diagnosis.They found that a broken piston ring was causing chamber low pressure. The only solution is replace the entire engine, because it's cheaper than trying to repair. The engine would cost $13,000 including install!! My heart dropped that moment. Luckily I found that I have a third party extended warranty. The fight with the third party took about three months to convince them about the issue because they wanted the dealer to open the engine so they can see the root cause of the failure. I denied the request because if they open the engine end they end up denying the repair for any reason, I will have to pay the man hour for it.After persistence, they decided to replace my engine with a used engine that they sent to the dealer, so I was okay with it since I just need the car on the road and I intended to sell it anyway.I paid $100 deductibles and took my car.

"Sep 30","2016","Fiesta SE","Jerking/Shuddering/Hesitation When Accelerating","56,500 miles","So a couple weeks back, I run the vehicle health report in my 2011 Ford Fiesta SE - hatch, if anyone cares. just for the sake of playing with the features and because i'm almost at 57k, and figured I should be getting ready for a checkup. Everything checked out wonderfully.However, right after, the ""seemingly normal"" rattle that my car used to give off while driving started to become significantly worse and way louder and noticeable immediately after this. Not sure if the health report is to blame, but it was the last thing I had done before things got crazy. The car at low speeds sounds ridiculous (loud, grinding, shuddering), it revs super high (like 3-5k just barely going 15-20mph), idles high and shakes the whole car. The gears slip when upshifting and they jerk REALLY HARD when downshifting. It feels dangerous driving in the city, because I'll try to slow down behind someone and it jerks forward and revs really hard and forces me to apply the brakes very hard to stop it from slamming into them. Upshifting is weird too, because it's unpredictable. If I try to merge into a highway or switch lanes, I need to wait for a HUGE gap before I trust that I can make it because sometimes it picks up, sometimes it doesn't. Sometimes I can't go more than 25mph then it suddenly slips and jerks into gear and goes faster. Needless to say the mechanic found nothing wrong with the car and zero fault codes. Then he replaced my alternator belt because it was pretty cooked.This went on for a week or so. I then ran the vehicle health report in the car again to see if it found any issues... nothing. Within 24 hours warning lights started to pop up. Not sure if the health report identified the issues or created the issues. I went ahead and googled a bunch of stuff after all my lights started going crazy and found these things to be linked to an FSA that Ford put out for the TCM. I went to my nearest dealer and they said they'd fix it and that it was covered. Lo and behold, I get a call saying it can't be fixed. The woman I spoke to tells me now that my alternator isn't charging the vehicle enough and the MAF sensor and throttle body are faulty and she can't update the TCM until those are fixed. They quoted me $1650 + tax (about $1800 with NY tax) - and I bet they'd expect a tip after that. They also said that this might not actually fix the problem. That it's just what they ""think is going to help."" So if I spend $1800 fixing the car and the problem recurs (like I've seen in a lot of complaints on here and other sites) - then what? I'm down a ton of money for no reason. This thing feels like a burden and I'm scared to really use it. I found a possible fix online for the alternator issue which involves buffing down the painted slab of metal that is grounding the battery, but I haven't tried it. I also revved the engine very hard on the highway like another fix said (which actually seemed to have helped a lot with upshifting, it still jerks and hesitates to pick up, but it seems a tiny bit better). If I can fix the alternator issue without having to replace it (I don't think it's bad, my mechanic didn't find any issues) then I can hopefully have the software reprogrammed and temporarily fix this problem. And why won't ford put out an FSA for the throttle body like they did with the Fusion? They know their stuff is faulty and they let these cars sit on the road... a hazard to everyone else."

"Feb 15","2022","Focus SE","Power Steering Failure","76,835 miles","I am the owner of a 2012 Ford Focus SE and I bought the vehicle in 2018. My car has recently developed a power steering failure, making the car unsafe to drive. I took the car into Ford and they quoted me $3,648.23 (Canadian) to replace the steering gear. I recently spent $1,300 to replace the front ball joints and now together with this next issue, there is a total of almost $5,000 in repairs I have had to make in the last 3 months of my four years of owning it. The car itself is 10 years old, and should not already have issues like this. The repairs alone are costing more than the Ford Focus is even worth."

This could be extremely serious if the failure occurs while driving. I will bring this up when I go in for the next oil change."

I called in and talked to them but when they got the car the issue was ""fine"" and they said if its not doing it then they can't tell me what's wrong.Now, it's gone out completely, it will cost $2540 dollars and the value of my car is 3000 to 4000 (2012 Ford Focus) - but with the issue not fixed, it's actually worth 1 to 2 thousand.

First the code u3000-53 deactivated pscm... Well and the ground issues they have and the 300 other issues, this is a really good scenario.

"Jul 20","2016","Focus SE I4","Power Steering Failure","50,000 miles","Power steering was intermittent since 2014, especially on hot days. Then finally in July 2016 the power steering completely failed. Prior to this Ford was unable to diagnose the issue if it was not actively occurring. . In 2019 I brought the vehicle in for a couple recall fixes and asked them to check the steering. They stated it would have to replace the entire electrical power steering unit for ~$2,500. Repair was not conducted.I had read in forums that this brand new (at the time) all electric power steering unit was placed too close to the engine exhaust manifold and too poorly heat shielded, frying the electrics. Rumor is that not enough reports of the issue, or deaths associated to loss of power steering while driving have occurred for Ford to issue a recall. Hopefully, this complaint helps."

Hard to stomach on a car with a $2000 trade-in value or $4500 private seller value. Why no recall on the Focus when Multiple other Ford models with the same problem were recalled? Ridiculous.

All the lights on the dash come and she does her best to get it to side of road. First time she was not sure what to do and left it there to have people come by and push it, only to restart and everything was just fine. She thought it was her fault so she didn't mention the first time, the second time she asked why it did that?

"Mar 28","2018","Focus LS 2.0L I4",Power Steering Failure","31,000 miles","Intermittently at random times the power in the power steering would fail creating a dangerous situation. Control of the vehicle would become difficult because of the large increase in effort to control the vehicle steering. Turning the vehicle off for a few minutes usually remedied the problem after you'd been scared to death from the loss of power steering. Steering control module was reset by local auto shop. They said there wasn't much they could do short of starting to replace parts in the system. They suggested taking the vehicle to a Ford Dealer because it was an ongoing issue with 2012 Ford Focus'.After 4 months the power steering completely failed. We took it to Fremont Ford in Fremont/Newark, CA. Big mistake on our part, it took them 1 day shy of 3 weeks with many un-returned calls. Ended up filing a complaint, Case #CAS14608637 with Ford to regarding the dealer and power steering failure situation.According to Fremont Ford, the cause of the power steering failure was the DMC connector, associated wiring from the steering computer to the steering module and the steering module/steering gear. Total cost for diagnosis, parts and labor was $2802.38. This is my daughter's car and I thank God that she was able to maintain control of the vehicle when the power steering failed. I truly believe this is a serious safety defect in the vehicle."

I've put more money into my ONE 2011 Audi A4 than all the other cars combined. No joke. In the four years I've owned my Audi, I've had to replace: all the fuel injectors, the intake manifold (twice), ignition coil, and now a cylinder head repair that will cost over $3,900 alone to fix. This is also the most fun car to drive I've ever owned, but because used cars are SO expensive right now - I'm stuck with this one. With all the repairs I've done - I'm just holding on to the false hope it actually will go a year without breaking down again. It's been undrivable every year that I've owned it, each year at least once. Oh, and it burns oil - about a 1/3 of a quart every 800 miles or so. Get used to seeing the 'low oil' indicator light."

Before purchasing the car, I asked the service manager what problems they saw. The burning of the oil was never mentioned and I have now called Bob Moore to speak with the service manager. My daughter barely drove it because she didn't have her license yet and around Christmas the low oil light came on. I added a quart and contacted my mechanic. We have had the oil changed, and she hasn't driven it 1,000 miles since the oil change - and the light is on again She has barely driven it 2,000 miles since I bought the car for her. Now, I am finding out that this type of engine is known for burning oil. So why did the dealership not disclose this when I asked them about the history, and is this going to be a major issue that I need to find my daughter another car?"

This problem is unrelated to the complaint but it prompted me to go through the car's computer menu where I discovered there was no oil in the engine. Normally the computer gives us a low oil warning but we didn't receive any such warning since the last oil change at 64,315 miles. There are now approximately 67,000 miles on the vehicle. I would have caught this sooner if I'd been able to check the oil manually but the geniuses at Audi decided not to put a dip stick on this car. The only way to know your oil level is low is for the car's computer to tell you, either with a dashboard warning, which we didn't receive, or by going through the computer menu. Oil level is the only information the computer gives you. It tells you nothing about the quality of the oil in the engine (is it dirty, gummy, etc.). There's a class action lawsuit against this model, which was settled around five years ago. I didn't apply for compensation prior to the application period for compensation expiring, because I wasn't having any oil issues until now."

My low oil light would always come on. I have since had several oil consumption tests and all parts changed out from all settlements yet my car remained to burn oil too rapidly and I have since took it into the dealership because 'check engine"" light came on and ""oil pressure too low' came on sometimes when I would turn. I have all service records to support me bringing my car to the dealership several times to solve this oil problem. No solution. My oil sensors were just changed Jan 2019 and a few months later when I would turn it told me my oil was too low. The light would pop up quick and go away. This happened 3 more times in one day and I checked it every time I checked it it said it was 3/4 full. I was baffled. The only thing I could think of was the oil sensor that was replaced wasn't giving a proper reading. I quickly pulled over to buy oil since it was an hour away from the dealership. bought a quart of oil and checked the oil. This time it said the oil was bone dry. I added a quart and tried starting the car yet it wouldn't start it sounded like it was going to start but wouldn't turn over.I panicked. I called the dealership before they left for the day and explained what was going on and verified that they had in fact changed the sensor which was called ""Oil Pressure Switch"". They said to have it towed in and so I had it towed in after hours-Fri night. I called several times yet it was a Sat; therefore, I didn't hear from them until Tuesday. They said I needed a new Timing chain and a few days later they said I need a new engine. They said they don't know how it happened and in order to take the engine apart it would be over $2500 and replacing the engine will cost me $15k."

I do my own work and maintenance so I know the ins and outs of my car.Now at 113,000 and still been adding oil till this day. I've looked everywhere for a solution and it's all the same thing to take it into the dealership. Not happy. Last time I had them do my timing chain with new guides they over filled my oil and my car ran like crap and was jerking.I did a recent tune up on it so I knew it wasn't anything I did. Even did an oil change before it went in. Just for the hell of it I decided to do another oil change which old had about 100 miles on. Well somehow I end up draining 10 quarts of oil out of my car and noticed it was leaking from the transmission oil cooler. It was a puddle of oil. I loosen all my oil lines and re-attached them and the leak went away. Dealership over filled my oil without draining it. Didn't have time to go back due to traveling for job.

That where she learned it was the clear coat that was failing and Honda did have a ""Technical Service Bulletin"" and had extended the paint warranty to 7 years.

Initially I thought what the hell is wrong with it? A work around was at that speed, gradually accelerate... but who wants to do that? But I did it and when I took the vehicle in for the 5k, I mentioned it and the dealership said it's the way it's designed...

I made an appointment with Toyota Service and mentioned the problem. You will need this case number if the check engine light isn't on. My check engine light never came on.

Front end of car was seriously damaged and my airbags did not deploy. I had a passenger/witness in my car and my son was inside the garage very near to where the car hit.

I took it to the local Toyota dealership to have it checked out. I told them I was having these issues and stated that other people were too, referring to the car forums. They took my car in and said they updated the software and it should be good now. It seemed to be fine for one day and then it started again with the lurching/jolting with the gears when driving. I took it to the Toyota dealership for a second time, telling them it is having the issue again and they said they would check it out. They had it for a day and then returned it back to me stating they couldnâ€™t find anything wrong.... I am still having these issues and iâ€™m furious. I purchased a Toyota because they were supposed to be reliable and safe. If I had known this was an issue with these cars I would have never bought a 2019 Rav4.

"Apr 12","2011","CR-V SE 4","Unwanted Acceleration When Braking","1,000 miles","This was my 4th Honda CrV. Car suddenly, but intermittently, would accelerate upon braking. Naturally, dealer could not duplicate the problem. I feared to drive this hazard and traded it immediately. I would like to buy a new CrV but simply cannot trust Honda. By the way, the CRV I test drove and thought I bought, turned out to be a different car. I checked the vin number on my purchase order and the dealer had substituted an identical new Crv indicating it didn't matter. The one I test drove and thought I purchased was made in Ohio, the one they gave me was made in Japan. I wonder if this hidden defect is associated with production sites? I didn't report this originally to anybody but the dealer. The dealer reported that they had heard about this problem, but hadn't experienced it and could not replicate it with my car. I have periodically monitored this site, and decided to add my complaint, albeit several years later. To this day every time I hit the brakes on my current carI wonder if they will work properly. As an expediency I traded the Crv for another Honda model with the same dealer and lost money in the process, but because it was fast and easy, and to its credit the dealer was accommodating. Nevertheless, I doubt I would ever trust Honda again with the wide variety of quality products out there today. I wonder what happened to the person who bought the very slightly used Crv and whether the dealer disclosed the undiagnosed braking/acceleration problem. Thanks. Ralph"

The cars temperature gauge only moves towards the center when the car is moving. Once is it half way, a normal car would then produce heat. Not this car! You turn the heat on and the gauge drops all the way down, to nothing! With the heat not working Iâ€™m left with windows that are foggy/icy which limits my visibility creating dangerous driving conditions. Even with driving on the highway for 30 minutes, the inside of the car is freezing, door windows are foggy and will start to have ice form on them and the front and rear windshields fog up and do not fully unfog."

When driving in temps 20 degrees or less (a daily occurrence in WI) the only way the vehicle temp gauge seems to rise is freeway speed driving for 10+ minutes. Upon stopping at a light the temp gauge routinely drops before my eyes. The air temp coming from the vents never seems to get ""hot"". Using the remote start to ""warm up the vehicle"" the car never comes off the ""C"" on the temp gauge. Once the vehicle comes to temp after freeway driving it doesn't hold temp. Once off the freeway the temp gauge starts dropping."

The climate control module was replaced as part of the recall. However, the car still will not warm up at a normal rate and the temp drops like a stone in idle. The recall fix did not solve the engine heat problem!!! I assume the oil dilution issue may continue as well as it is related to engine temps not being hot enough on short trips."

Wrote to Honda, who provided me with non-sense suggestions to resolve this such as plug-in heater and drive low gear, etc.... I don't understand that Honda is not addressing this. I just became aware that the main consumer organization in Quebec, Protegez-vous, is no longer recommending this vehicle to consumers because of this issue.... Sad, I have owned Honda vehicles for over 40 years."

During the winter, if you don't drive the temperature never raise and the cabin temperature stay cold. If there is ice on the windshield you have to remove it with a scraper. Even after 20 minutes at idle there is not heat. If the temperature of the engine raise a little pray not to stop on a red light for a long period because the temperature of the engine start to drop.

I have an 02 Corolla that has several mechanical issues that are a pain in the ass. It is currently burning 1 qt for every 150 miles, maybe even 1.5 on a lucky day. I've been told to replace the engine (not only for this reason), but it is also too far gone to be attempting to repair. One of the previous owners kind of neglected the car, let it leak out too much oil and caused some major damage to the engine. I only bought the car for $600, so no, I will not go and cry to Toyota about this since people can't seem to take care of their vehicles."

I refilled the oil and drove the car for a few more weeks, then checked the oil level and had the same exact problem, the oil level was halfway down."

I've done an engine flush with Amsoil. Added Amsoil oil as some of you guys have suggested and within three days my oil stick showed that it was bone dry. ""Bullshit"". We need to all band together and protest against Toyota to do something about this issue."

Soon after I had an engine flush and the light went off but eventually came back on. I had the code checked & reset and it was a minor problem so I didn't get it fixed but then it did not pass emissions."
"Jan 03","2013","Corolla CE","Engine Uses Excessive Oil","137,000 miles","I love my 2002 Toyota Corolla. I had it for 8 years now, bought it used with 28000 miles on it and it now has 137000. I rave about my car to my co-workers who are having problems with theirs and always brag about how good my car is but that is now over. I religiously do the oil change every 3000miles or every 3 months whichever comes first. I mean I am really good at keeping up with it but twice in a row now, I went for an oil change and the guy tell me that my oil was really really low - both times I wondered why because my oil was not leaking and I don't drive a lot, then around Jan 3 with still 700miles to go before my oil change, my car started rattling like the engine is going to fall off, about a week or 2 before this I noticed that my oil light comes on every time I break for a few seconds then goes away - I didn't think much of it. 2 days after I heard the rattling noise, the noise had gotten worse so I took it in to car shop and here the guy is telling me that my engine oil was bone dry. I don't understand why!! So now I have to keep oil in my garage and maybe refilling it every 1000 miles, this is not good news and I hope Toyota can make this issue go away with the newer models."
"Jun 01","2008","Corolla CE","Engine Uses Excessive Oil","70,215 miles","In June 2008 I heard my engine rattling when coming in the driveway and when I checked my oil level it was almost completely out! I thought I lost the oil cap or oil pan screw but it was the engine burning the oil. Every 1000km I had to add 1 litre to 1.5 litres of 10W-30 oil while the car calls for 5W-30. I started an excel spreadsheet to track my dipstick levels every Sunday morning before I drive to track it. Since my car was just over the 100,000km warranty Toyota wouldn't help unless I could produce every oil change receipt to have partial coverage paid and even then it would have cost me $3000 to fix without the receipts. It's now August 2013 and I'm getting about 800km before adding 1-2 litres of oil as well as Lucas Oil additive to help reduce burning. It's cheaper then the alternative. Other than that the car runs fine. My engine light just came on a week ago but I figure it's the O2 sensor from all the burning oil. To date I would say roughly I have added 106 litres of 10W-30 to the engine between oil changes ever 5000km. Yes, it's annoying to check this each week, but now I have a usage timeline and when I get a new car I will start a new spreadsheet from day 1 that has one page for services at what mileage with invoice numbers and a second page parts I may get like wiper blades, air filters, etc and page three is my oil consumption based on points on the dipstick and mileage recording. If the engine runs fine then you may never have to use page three much, but it helps to have all things recorded when you go to the dealer!!!"
"Feb 10","2011","Corolla S 1.8L","Engine Uses Excessive Oil","100,000 miles","I also own a 2002 Toyota corolla S, I purchased it in December of 2002, there has been no recall on the excessive oil usage problem, how ever there was a service statement released on it. Which means, hey we know this is a big problem but since it won't kill anybody tough crap we aren't going to fix it. But at least you can tell your mechanic what the problem is and they can charge you out the wazoo to replace the engine or the seals in it. I believe when I read the service statement out on it the problem was with the type of seals used. I wish I would have known about the problem which isn't possible since I purchased it when the car was only a year old, I still have to admit that is the only thing that has caused a problem until now, I think my head has a leak in it. but the car has been reliable non the less. Just pissed that they won't fix the known problem with the engine."

My daughter bought this car new and the engine blew at 58,000 miles (one month out of warranty). We replaced the engine and I got the car from her when she bought a new minivan. Now the car has 20,000 miles on the used replacement engine and uses excessive oil every 300mi or so. I've used only full-synthetic and just holding my breath until this engine blows....scumbags Toyota! It's definitley burning it, have oil smear on the bumper around the tailpipe.

Every time I add more oil in the engine, it keeps burning. Right now I am at 170,000 and for every 200 miles, I would add a quart of oil. I must always remember to check it or else the engine may burn out. Is anyone else having the same problem? I'm sure there are people who have the same issue as me. It would be nice to all file a complaint about this issue because it's a major issue."

"May 07","2010","Corolla S","Engine Uses Excessive Oil","136,000 miles","I purchased a 2002 Toyota Corolla S in 2001. Great car & no major maintenance until I hit 90,000 miles. My engine was making a winding/rattling noise upon acceleration which seemed to come & go. I also noticed my oil would disappear between oil changes. The stick was completely dry but no oil light or engine light ever came on. I took it to a Toyota dealership and they did a oil test and had me run it for 500 miles to see how much would be used. There was not really anything gone at that point. They told me the car was getting old and that I should consider either replacing the engine which would cost $3900.00 or I could get a new car. I left there thinking they just want to sell me a new car. I took the car to numerous places & no one could ever tell me where the oil is going but to just keep adding oil so your engine doesn't blow. I have been doing this for the past 2 years now and it is so bad that I only put 3000 or less miles on a 3 month span & I am adding 2 quarts of oil in it. The car now has 139,000 miles on it and as I just turned off the engine as I parked it in the parking lot at work I noticed noises coming from the engine after the car was turned off. I suspect I may go out there after work & something major may have happened. If so, I will call the junk yard since that is what it is at this point. I am very sorry I bought this car. I bought it on the basis that everyone I knew told me I could easily get 250,000 miles on those cars! I will never buy a Toyota again! Toyota won't help anyone. Since I cannot afford a new car I guess I will have to walk to work!!! Thanks Toyota!!!"

It started using oil every week and I never had time to check it out and repair it. I thought I am now a statistic for being burned by Toyota with a lemon. It otherwise runs great but I check the gas and fill the oil. I came upon this site by accident looking for answers to the problem. I thought I better add my car to this complaint site, right away. So here's hoping Toyota will pay attention and salvage us as possible bad publicity to their reputation. Thank-you so much for this site and the opportunity to make a legitimate gripe to Toyota."

I have spent a total $84,000 on toyota vehicles and these problems I am reading about with the corollas is really pissing me off. My 2002 corolla is burning excessive oil so I took it to my mechanic. It started using oil probably at 100,000 miles and now it is like a quart every couple hundred miles. My mechanic said it has excessive blow by meaning rings and or pistons are shot. He gave me a price of $3,000.00 for a used motor with 59,000 miles on it. I thought that was crazy especially if this is common problem with the 1.8 liter. I would replace my blown motor with another piece of s++t one. I think we should all get together and bring a lawsuit against toyota and make them recall these engines until all of us are satisfied. I am really considering selling my current toyotas and buying american again."
