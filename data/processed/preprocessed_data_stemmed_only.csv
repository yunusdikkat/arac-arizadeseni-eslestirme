Jul 20,2017,Fiesta,Transmission Failed,"39,234 miles","Since 2011, there have been numerous issues. The vehicle has not reached 40,000 miles because there is always something wrong with it. As of now, there is transmission failure, jerking, shuddering, electrical problems, and steering problems. Also, the engine dies while driving. I want to get rid of it, but CarMax told the vehicle is worthless in its condition. This car has been a nightmare.","['sinc', '2011', 'numer', 'issu', 'vehicl', 'reach', '40000', 'mile', 'alway', 'someth', 'wrong', 'transmiss', 'failur', 'jerk', 'shudder', 'electr', 'problem', 'steer', 'problem', 'also', 'engin', 'die', 'drive', 'want', 'get', 'rid', 'carmax', 'told', 'vehicl', 'worthless', 'condit', 'car', 'nightmar']"

The car currently is at Ford dealership where they replaced transmission clutch and transmission modulator and other minor things. They called me to come get my car, it was fixed. So I drive there, pay a repair bill and get my key..however I didn't make it off the lot when I heard horrible grinding noises. I took key right back inside and told them this is not fixed, something is not right..keep in mind I never left the lot with my car. They had my car for another 3 months then finally call and tell me, oh your car needs a whole new transmission....another 3000$!!! This year, make and model car has an extended warranty for 100,000 miles....this car only has 50,000 on it....they are telling me warranty won't cover new transmission.

I have always had a quality vehicle Navigator, Mustang, F150, and an old f100 but this vehicle has killed all fords for me. I have had the throttle body replaced around 30k, the alternator around 40k, the fan actually caught on fire at the dealership while diagnosing my a/c and it took them 2 weeks to fix that, then from 55-100k the vehicle did not have ANY issues which I was happy with. Then in October my transmission goes out....I paid to have it pulled by AAMCO and there is a seal on the interior of the shift linkage that was busted and I had the slave cylinder, throw out bearing(part of the slave cylinder) and clutch kit replaced.

Mar 14,2015,Fiesta SE 4 cyl,Transmission Failed,"42,000 miles","We bought this Fiesta in February 2015. We have had so many problems since then. I strongly believe that the dealership knew of the problem that the car had before selling it to us. When we go to drive it there is grinding from 1st to 2nd. As well as it grinding from 2nd to 3rd sometimes. We have very little to no power in the transmission at all. The recalls that came out on the car not long after we bought it, have never been performed by the dealership. They had told us ""We will call you when we get the parts in, but the car will not drive any differently"" Well obviously that is not true. This is my fiance's daily driver and we are so troubled about this. If this transmission goes out we are totally screwed. We can barely afford the payment let alone a new transmission. Please someone help us to find a way to get this crooked dealership to honor the recall and warranty, it was still under warranty when we first brought it to their attention. We are just trying to get along in this world with 3 kids and without this car we are screwed.

Nov 05,2016,Fiesta SES,Transmission Failed,"100,000 miles","After having the car for two years, the car just simply quit and is not covered at all since it is a transmission issue for a 2011 Ford Fiesta that has just reached 100000km. I had to replace the transmission at my expense. They would not give me a car a courtesy car, they would not even offer to have the shuttle drive me to work. I had to walk the 2km from the bus stop when the location was a five minute drive from the dealership.They would not guarantee the work even though they know that this car has transmission problems and it may have to be done again and again. Consumers of Ford produces are bleed dry when Ford is fully aware that they are offering the public a faulty product. A product which will one day cause someone to loose their life driving something that jerks, coasts, and delays shifting. Ford advertises the product as a automatic when what is repeatedly requiring replacement is a clutch.In the 35 years that I have driven cars I have never had to replace a clutch in any other automatic car. I can't empathize enough if you want a reliable car do not purchase a Ford or you as a consumer will be bleed financially for a product that they are not pulling or recalling until someone dies because of their mistake.

Jan 08,2016,Fiesta SE 4,Transmission Failed,"127,047 miles","I purchased this car in good faith from Ford, knowing that that I drive 100 miles daily. I need reliable transportation. I have had the clutch and TCM replace a couple of times This part has failed yet again. Ford is aware that this is a design flaw; they extended the warranty to 120,000 miles. Now since my car is out to warranty and since there is a recall on the part needed; I am SOL. I still owe $10,000 on this car. Since I have put over 120,000 miles on the car all repairs are on me; okay fine whatever.Since the part is being re-tooled I have to wait for a repair ; I have been told it could take six months to a year or longer. So in the mean time I still have a car payment, I still have to pay for the insurance, I get to look at my pretty little green car sitting in my yard every day as I have to rely on other people to get to work, (Not an easy feat being 48 miles from work). I am not very happy with Ford.Other than the transmission issues I have been happy with this car. the gas mileage is great, I have been lucky with it up to this point.

Nov 29,2015,Fiesta SE 4,Transmission Failed,"61,400 miles","We purchased a 2011 Ford Fiesta in October 2015 from our neighbor, who kept meticulous care and service records on the vehicle. The vehicle was always dealer serviced and had been in for the transmission service bulletins. Within 60 days of owning the vehicle the transmission failed. The car backed out of the garage, and upon shifting to drive it would not go into gear, but the engine would rev. The car starts up just fine, but will not go into any gear.We had the car immediately towed to the local dealer. The dealer replaced the Transmission Control Module, but that did not fix the problem. The dealer now reports we need a new transmission. $6500 + tax. We have been told by both the dealer and Ford corporate that we are 1,400 miles over warranty at 61,400 miles, so there is no financial assistance with the repair. We have talked to a Ford regional service manager in Florida who repeats the same denial of assistance. This is the first Ford we have ever owned. The communication from Ford makes it clear to us that Ford does not stand behind their products. This transmission has had many service bulletins and complaints. Should we even be able to afford the new transmission, what are we to do if that one fails soon after going past the much more limited warranty (fewer years, fewer miles)? We were hopeful that Ford would want to resolve the problem with us, as Ford also has a stake in this issue with regard to product quality and how they treat customers. Unfortunately, theyâ€™ve made it clear we are on our own. We are now very discouraged. If anyone at Ford reads this and can help us, we would love to hear from you.","['purchas', '2011', 'ford', 'fiesta', 'octob', '2015', 'neighbor', 'kept', 'meticul', 'care', 'servic', 'record', 'vehicl', 'vehicl', 'alway', 'dealer', 'servic', 'transmiss', 'servic', 'bulletin', 'within', '60', 'day', 'own', 'vehicl', 'transmiss', 'fail', 'car', 'back', 'garag', 'upon', 'shift', 'drive', 'would', 'go', 'gear', 'engin', 'would', 'rev', 'car', 'start', 'fine', 'go', 'gearw', 'car', 'immedi', 'tow', 'local', 'dealer', 'dealer', 'replac', 'transmiss', 'control', 'modul', 'fix', 'problem', 'dealer', 'report', 'need', 'new', 'transmiss', '6500', 'tax', 'told', 'dealer', 'ford', 'corpor', '1400', 'mile', 'warranti', '61400', 'mile', 'financi', 'assist', 'repair', 'talk', 'ford', 'region', 'servic', 'manag', 'florida', 'repeat', 'denial', 'assist', 'first', 'ford', 'ever', 'own', 'commun', 'ford', 'make', 'clear', 'us', 'ford', 'stand', 'behind', 'product', 'transmiss', 'mani', 'servic', 'bulletin', 'complaint', 'even', 'abl', 'afford', 'new', 'transmiss', 'one', 'fail', 'soon', 'go', 'past', 'much', 'limit', 'warranti', 'fewer', 'year', 'fewer', 'mile', 'hope', 'ford', 'would', 'want', 'resolv', 'problem', 'us', 'ford', 'also', 'stake', 'issu', 'regard', 'product', 'qualiti', 'treat', 'custom', 'unfortun', 'theyâv', 'made', 'clear', 'discourag', 'anyon', 'ford', 'read', 'help', 'us', 'would', 'love', 'hear']"

Feb 10,2015,Fiesta Powershift 1.6L,Transmission Failed,"68,500 miles","My transmission went out. Almost no warning, it just wouldn't shift right, so I took it to the transmission specialists to find out what was wrong. When they hooked it up to the computer, they said that first, third and fifth gears were not engaging and it was starting in 2nd, shifting to 4th and then 6th gear. Reverse was still working, thankfully! However, to get it fixed, the biggest problem was that since this was such a new (relatively) vehicle, Ford is not making/selling the parts to fix it. The transmission guy said he could fix it for around $2000 IF the parts were available. But since they are not available, his only alternative was to replace the transmission. Parts (wholesale prices) would be $3900 for the new transmission (which would only be guaranteed to work 3 years) plus labor to install it for a total of $4800. I just checked and Ford is still not selling the parts, so I guess I'll have to sell it for what I can get out of it. I can't see spending another $5K to have it do this again in 3 years! I drove it around town for another 45 days or so and then another gear went out. Now it won't go above 30 miles per hour unless I'm on a downward incline. I might get it up to 38 or 40 mph, but I can't sustain that speed on level ground. I guess I lost 4th/6th gears. Anyone wanna buy this?

Jul 02,2019,Outback 2.4L,Excessive Oil Consumption,"86,000 miles","As many others have noted on this forum, this car has an oil consumption problem. I took it to Nate Wade Subaru in Salt Lake City and had this problem assessed at least six different times. The first time, I was about 3,000 miles into an oil change and the light came on. I brought it into Nate Wade and they started an oil consumption test, which I passed. The problem seemed nonexistent through the remainder of the 5,000 miles I had until the next change.I then changed my oil at home before a trip to Calgary. At almost 3,000 miles on the nose, the light comes back on. I take it to Subaru and they replace the oil sensor light and tell me that this should definitely fix the problem. They topped me off with oil and sent me on my way. Again, with no problems until the next change.I change my oil at my place once more, and again we come to the same issue on another road trip. I understand that the oil problem is exacerbated by prolonged trips in the car, but I bought this car with the intention of using it for road trips, so this is especially disappointing.I bring this issue to Nate Wade again and they say there is nothing they can do for me. They've given me the perfunctory oil consumption test and if I want to explore this issue further I should contact Subaru of America. So, I do, and they start another test. I schedule a trip to the Grand Canyon because I definitely want to fail this test and if I have been having problems on road trips, I might as well take one... I check the oil before embarking because I want to see how much it changed over the course of the trip and I am appalled.

Jun 30,2018,Outback Premium 2.5L,Excessive Oil Consumption,"98,500 miles","I bought a 2013 Subaru Outback from an Audi Dealer who advertised it on Auto Trader. I was looking for a Subaru and found it to be a good price with an extended, but limited, warranty. It was a pretty good deal and it brought my interest rate down a point which made it more or less affordable. About two weeks after I purchased it, the oil light came on. I took it back to Audi and they told me to take it to Subaru.I took it to Subaru and they did an oil consumption test which they said passed. I found out that this car had been in several times from a previous owner for the same issue. While I was there the second time, another customer was there for the same problem. I wrote letters, had a second test done, sent emails back and forth to a Subaru representative for 7 months with no avail. They told me to check my oil every time I filled up the car. I drive over 1,500 miles a month! Are you kidding me?My car requires oil topped off every 1,300 miles or less. The test's limit for oil consumption is1,200. How ironic that my vehicle runs low on oil approximately 100 miles from the the set limit imposed by a class action lawsuit. This tells me that Subaru has figured out where the threshold is on the oil running low and set it below that threshold so that most, if not all, customers doing the oil consumption test will pass it. Therefore, these cars are not being fixed by Subaru. I'm going to complain on this website, on Twitter, put a sign on my car and drive around three to five counties every month telling everyone that unbeknownst to me. I bought a defective vehicle which the manufacturer will not fix, even though several mechanics confirm the problem and say the vehicle will eventually stop working because of the piston rings being defective.","['bought', '2013', 'subaru', 'outback', 'audi', 'dealer', 'advertis', 'auto', 'trader', 'look', 'subaru', 'found', 'good', 'price', 'extend', 'limit', 'warranti', 'pretti', 'good', 'deal', 'brought', 'interest', 'rate', 'point', 'made', 'less', 'afford', 'two', 'week', 'purchas', 'oil', 'light', 'came', 'took', 'back', 'audi', 'told', 'take', 'subarui', 'took', 'subaru', 'oil', 'consumpt', 'test', 'said', 'pass', 'found', 'car', 'sever', 'time', 'previou', 'owner', 'issu', 'second', 'time', 'anoth', 'custom', 'problem', 'wrote', 'letter', 'second', 'test', 'done', 'sent', 'email', 'back', 'forth', 'subaru', 'repres', '7', 'month', 'avail', 'told', 'check', 'oil', 'everi', 'time', 'fill', 'car', 'drive', '1500', 'mile', 'month', 'kid', 'memi', 'car', 'requir', 'oil', 'top', 'everi', '1300', 'mile', 'less', 'test', 'limit', 'oil', 'consumpt', 'is1200', 'iron', 'vehicl', 'run', 'low', 'oil', 'approxim', '100', 'mile', 'set', 'limit', 'impos', 'class', 'action', 'lawsuit', 'tell', 'subaru', 'figur', 'threshold', 'oil', 'run', 'low', 'set', 'threshold', 'custom', 'oil', 'consumpt', 'test', 'pass', 'therefor', 'car', 'fix', 'subaru', 'im', 'go', 'complain', 'websit', 'twitter', 'put', 'sign', 'car', 'drive', 'around', 'three', 'five', 'counti', 'everi', 'month', 'tell', 'everyon', 'unbeknownst', 'bought', 'defect', 'vehicl', 'manufactur', 'fix', 'even', 'though', 'sever', 'mechan', 'confirm', 'problem', 'say', 'vehicl', 'eventu', 'stop', 'work', 'piston', 'ring', 'defect']"

My wife called the dealership and they told her oil burn off was normal and it wasnâ€™t a big deal. So we added a qt or two in and have done so every since for the last almost 6 yrs. We got notices for other recalls but never for the oil consumption issue, now our car needs a little tlc and maintenance so I was looking around online to figure out some of those issues along with inquiring about this oil consumption issue and read other owners were complaining about it and thatâ€™s how I found out that Subaru had a class action law suit back in 2016 where they were fixing this issue and we were never notified by them or the dealership that sold us the car...now we are over our warranty mileage...they did offer to do the oil consumption test, but wouldnâ€™t go any further, Iâ€™m hoping they will do right by us, but Iâ€™m not really sure theyâ€™ll show us the â€œLOVEâ€...for the last 6 yrs I have bought countless quarts of oil and have wished we had gotten the 4Runner or Wrangler ever since...pretty sure we will never purchase another Subaru again...darn shame too, because on paper they seem like the â€œgo toâ€ car that canâ€™t be beat, but in reality Iâ€™m not sure anyone should spend their hard earned money on this brand any longer...their marketing department fooled us 6 yrs ago, but I wonâ€™t fall for it again...Iâ€™ll be looking into vehicles with real long lasting ability and a track record to prove it, not just some marketing campaign with cute dogs and lgbtq ad manipulation...Iâ€™m writing this on 12/12/2018 and the outback is at the dealership getting the oil consumption test done as I type...I won even get into the bs of the technician trying to up sale me to get me to pay for a light bulb replacement for a light that wasnâ€™t out while getting the air bag and windshield wiper motor recalled fixed...or the fact that the radiator went out right after our two yr warranty ended...I definitely donâ€™t get the loyal brand following on this thing...I really wanted to â€œLOVEâ€ this outback too...I was planning on upgrading to the new ascent, but will definitely be looking at the Grand Cherokee or 4Runner now...really bummed out","['wifeâ', 'first', 'brand', 'new', 'car', 'ever', 'purchas', 'realli', 'excit', 'itw', 'heard', 'noth', 'great', 'thing', 'subaruâ', 'final', 'felt', 'like', 'âœgrown', 'upsâ', 'make', 'thought', 'matur', 'practic', 'decis', 'purchas', '2013', 'subaru', 'outbackw', 'two', 'kid', 'plan', 'travel', 'research', 'felt', 'like', 'âœgo', 'carâw', 'also', 'look', 'jeep', 'wrangler', 'toyota', '4runnerour', 'main', 'goal', 'car', 'could', 'go', '300k', 'build', 'life', 'memori', 'kid', 'along', 'wayaft', 'first', 'free', 'oil', 'chang', 'outback', 'came', 'like', '2', 'yr', 'free', 'oil', 'chang', '24k', 'someth', 'like', 'notic', 'oil', 'light', 'came', 'almost', 'week', 'done', 'wife', 'call', 'dealership', 'told', 'oil', 'burn', 'normal', 'wasnât', 'big', 'deal', 'ad', 'qt', 'two', 'done', 'everi', 'sinc', 'last', 'almost', '6', 'yr', 'got', 'notic', 'recal', 'never', 'oil', 'consumpt', 'issu', 'car', 'need', 'littl', 'tlc', 'mainten', 'look', 'around', 'onlin', 'figur', 'issu', 'along', 'inquir', 'oil', 'consumpt', 'issu', 'read', 'owner', 'complain', 'thatâ', 'found', 'subaru', 'class', 'action', 'law', 'suit', 'back', '2016', 'fix', 'issu', 'never', 'notifi', 'dealership', 'sold', 'us', 'carnow', 'warranti', 'mileagethey', 'offer', 'oil', 'consumpt', 'test', 'wouldnât', 'go', 'iâm', 'hope', 'right', 'us', 'iâm', 'realli', 'sure', 'theyâll', 'show', 'us', 'âœloveâfor', 'last', '6', 'yr', 'bought', 'countless', 'quart', 'oil', 'wish', 'gotten', '4runner', 'wrangler', 'ever', 'sincepretti', 'sure', 'never', 'purchas', 'anoth', 'subaru', 'againdarn', 'shame', 'paper', 'seem', 'like', 'âœgo', 'toâ', 'car', 'canât', 'beat', 'realiti', 'iâm', 'sure', 'anyon', 'spend', 'hard', 'earn', 'money', 'brand', 'longertheir', 'market', 'depart', 'fool', 'us', '6', 'yr', 'ago', 'wonât', 'fall', 'againiâl', 'look', 'vehicl', 'real', 'long', 'last', 'abil', 'track', 'record', 'prove', 'market', 'campaign', 'cute', 'dog', 'lgbtq', 'ad', 'manipulationiâm', 'write', '12122018', 'outback', 'dealership', 'get', 'oil', 'consumpt', 'test', 'done', 'typei', 'even', 'get', 'bs', 'technician', 'tri', 'sale', 'get', 'pay', 'light', 'bulb', 'replac', 'light', 'wasnât', 'get', 'air', 'bag', 'windshield', 'wiper', 'motor', 'recal', 'fixedor', 'fact', 'radiat', 'went', 'right', 'two', 'yr', 'warranti', 'endedi', 'definit', 'donât', 'get', 'loyal', 'brand', 'follow', 'thingi', 'realli', 'want', 'âœloveâ', 'outback', 'tooi', 'plan', 'upgrad', 'new', 'ascent', 'definit', 'look', 'grand', 'cheroke', '4runner', 'nowreal', 'bum']"

Jun 04,2015,Outback 2.5i Premium 4 cyl,Excessive Oil Consumption,"120,000 miles","I purchased my 2013 Outback in August 2012 from IRA Subaru in Danvers, MA. My first issue was around 65000 miles when my oil light came on. I checked the oil and it was down a quart but I still had 1500 miles before I was due for an oil change. I talked to the Dealer - the book said change oil every 7500 miles, but the Dealer said it depended on how you drive and where I put a lot of mileage on my car, it was recommended changing the oil every 6000 miles. So that sounded like a Plan!It got progressively worse and by 92000 miles I was adding 3/4 qts of oil per oil change. It was recommended that I have an oil consumption test done, but I was also told in order to Fail the OCT the car had to be going through a qt of oil every 1200 miles. I knew at the time I wouldn't fail the test, so I put it off. I had purchased the 100,000 mile extended warranty when I bought the car and was concerned the warranty would expire before I officially Failed the OCT. But I was told by the Dealer (Twin City Subaru Berlin, VT) that it shouldn't matter because we identified the problem while still under the Extended Warranty. Finally at 107,000 miles I was confident I would Fail the test and had it done. And it Failed! Then I was told by the same Dealer that where it was now past 100,000 miles mark, Subaru Would Not cover any repairs!! The Dealer gave me the phone number to talk to Subaru directly and they told me the same thing.The car now has 120,000 miles and I am adding 1 qt every 500/600 miles, how ridiculous is that? I just finished paying for the car this fall and what is a car like this worth now that its paid for? Who would ever purchase a car burning this much oil?

Aug 03,2016,Outback 2.5L,Excessive Oil Consumption,"20,724 miles","In June 2016, I bought a 2013 Outback 2.5L with 19,224 miles from a Subaru dealership about 33 miles from my home town. I paid extra for Certified pre-owned status. I thought it was a good deal since it had low miles, and the dealership told me the previous owners were an older couple who only averaged 5600 miles a year.Of course, about a month or so (1500 miles) later the oil light came on. I had to stop at a gas station and put a quart in. I knew this wasn't right since the dealer told me they just did an oil change and that I wouldn't have to add or change the oil for another 6500 miles. I did some investigation and learned about the class action lawsuit related to high oil consumption for many Subaru models, including my own.Next time I took it in to my local dealer, I asked for an oil consumption test. They did an oil change, filled the oil and told me to bring it back after I'd driven it 1200 - 1500 miles. I did so (closer to 1500 miles), and they found that it burned twice the amount of oil they expected. They said because my car was still under warranty, they were going to replace the engine block, which they did in January 2017.It did not cost me anything except the pain and aggravation of being misled by the original dealership which knew this model and year were included in the class action lawsuit, but still sold it to me at a typically elevated dealership price without disclosing the issue. Additionally I'm now in possession of a car which had the engine block replaced at 24,000 miles, which very likely will reduce the value and make it more difficult for me to sell on the private market or to trade it in for a reasonable amount.","['june', '2016', 'bought', '2013', 'outback', '25l', '19224', 'mile', 'subaru', 'dealership', '33', 'mile', 'home', 'town', 'paid', 'extra', 'certifi', 'preown', 'statu', 'thought', 'good', 'deal', 'sinc', 'low', 'mile', 'dealership', 'told', 'previou', 'owner', 'older', 'coupl', 'averag', '5600', 'mile', 'yearof', 'cours', 'month', '1500', 'mile', 'later', 'oil', 'light', 'came', 'stop', 'ga', 'station', 'put', 'quart', 'knew', 'wasnt', 'right', 'sinc', 'dealer', 'told', 'oil', 'chang', 'wouldnt', 'add', 'chang', 'oil', 'anoth', '6500', 'mile', 'investig', 'learn', 'class', 'action', 'lawsuit', 'relat', 'high', 'oil', 'consumpt', 'mani', 'subaru', 'model', 'includ', 'ownnext', 'time', 'took', 'local', 'dealer', 'ask', 'oil', 'consumpt', 'test', 'oil', 'chang', 'fill', 'oil', 'told', 'bring', 'back', 'id', 'driven', '1200', '1500', 'mile', 'closer', '1500', 'mile', 'found', 'burn', 'twice', 'amount', 'oil', 'expect', 'said', 'car', 'still', 'warranti', 'go', 'replac', 'engin', 'block', 'januari', '2017it', 'cost', 'anyth', 'except', 'pain', 'aggrav', 'misl', 'origin', 'dealership', 'knew', 'model', 'year', 'includ', 'class', 'action', 'lawsuit', 'still', 'sold', 'typic', 'elev', 'dealership', 'price', 'without', 'disclos', 'issu', 'addit', 'im', 'possess', 'car', 'engin', 'block', 'replac', '24000', 'mile', 'like', 'reduc', 'valu', 'make', 'difficult', 'sell', 'privat', 'market', 'trade', 'reason', 'amount']"

Aug 14,2013,Outback,Excessive Oil Consumption,"4,300 miles","I bought this Subaru new and the dealer Doyle Subaru/Chevolet in Webster,New York is just playing games until it comes out from under the 100,000 mile warranty or reaches 5 years which ever comes first. I have to carry oil with me as I never know when the oil pressure light will come on and I will have to add oil. I must check it regularly before I start on a trip or plan to drive more than 30 miles. It drops 2 quarts or more. The last time it went in to the dealership, they messed with the oil pressure light so it will not come on. That means a very regular check of the oil on my part. I have a local garage keeping records on the car as I get the dealer to do the oil changes under their warranty. This is Subaru #9 in our family. All were Outbacks but two Legacies and we never had oil usage problems with any of them. We take them off the road at about 275,000 miles and expect them to last. This 2013 has 61,453 miles on it and it is called on to travel around New York State, Pa and Ohio hauling a load of show rabbits to different show locals. I do not expect that I will keep it much beyond 100,000 miles unless Subaru steps up and admits that they have a problem and solves it. Will there be Subaru #10??? That will depend on how they solve the problems with #9 over the next 3 years. If they can not then I will dump the vehicle and look at another brand. I do not trust the dealer and that is why I have an independent garage watching the oil usage and keeping records on it.

Added 1 qt and took the car into the dealer for an oil consumption test. Dealership recommends that you return after driving 1,000-1,200 miles. However, the oil level indicated a 50% overfill when the oil change occurred. Because of this, I did not return for the first consumption test, but monitored at home. Level dropped to empty at 3,000-3,500 miles. When back to the dealer for a repeat of the consumption test. Again, the oil level was overfilled by 50%. Talked to the service manager, who explained this was the result of oil from elsewhere int the engine settling with time. However, I checked both after driving and a few hours after rest and level was unchanged. With previous vehicles and previous oil change services, the technicians always showed the dipstick level at full following the change, to indicate to me the amount added was appropriate.The salesperson at the dealership acknowledged the 2013 Outbacks had piston rings that were manufactured below specifications, but the bar repair is high. I am having a difficult time trusting the dealership after two deceptive services. I purchased both Outbacks with the intention of making them 10yr cars, but the excessive oil consumption concerns me for engine longevity. There are two pending class action lawsuits regarding this oil consumption problem, a problem that Subaru will not acknowledge.Will never consider the purchase of a Subaru in the future.

Aug 11,2015,Outback 3.6L,Excessive Oil Consumption,"51,000 miles","We brought in the Subaru Outback every 4k miles for an oil change as scheduled by the dealer. Yes we know synthetic oil lasts longer but..... anyway, after all the free oil changes we started to change the oil ourselves. Then checking the oil, water, etc... and found the car was needing a qt added, so we took it to another dealer for an oil change and had them check the oil before the car went away. It was 1/2 qt low and of course filled to the correct level when we picked it up. Adding more oil before the next oil change I googled oil consumption and from there we went to our regular dealer and the oil consumption test started.At 1200 miles we were a bit under a 1/3 qt low. I video taped the crappy service rep as he looked at the dip stick. Hope we were the final nail in his dismissal letter. Anyway, we went in and another rep told him the 1/3 warranted an engine block to be ordered and no more consumption tests. I waited a week before calling about an update on the block. It had never been ordered. Spoke to the service manager and he said the test was completed. I told him to look at the first line of the test that said if it was this low, order a block. I also told him that the level, 250 miles later, was at the middle dot in the dip stick and I could hear the valves knocking. I also told him the twit never added oil to bring the level back up. But if he wanted me to drive the car until the thing blew up, say so...you are being recorded. Short tale is: Bring the car back, here is a loaner Forrester to drive for 2-3 weeks while the car is repaired.I also mentione o the service manager that the 3.6 is not the normal complaint for this, it's the 2.5 (?) and he said correct. Wonder how many 3.6 engine owners have their oil changed frequently and never realized their engine problem until it is out of warranty. We have never heard a more a$$nine statement than ""it's normal oil consumption"" when our 16 year old Durango has never consumed a drop between oil changes.I'm going to monitor other sites to see if I can find another 3.6 report of a problem.","['brought', 'subaru', 'outback', 'everi', '4k', 'mile', 'oil', 'chang', 'schedul', 'dealer', 'ye', 'know', 'synthet', 'oil', 'last', 'longer', 'anyway', 'free', 'oil', 'chang', 'start', 'chang', 'oil', 'check', 'oil', 'water', 'etc', 'found', 'car', 'need', 'qt', 'ad', 'took', 'anoth', 'dealer', 'oil', 'chang', 'check', 'oil', 'car', 'went', 'away', '12', 'qt', 'low', 'cours', 'fill', 'correct', 'level', 'pick', 'ad', 'oil', 'next', 'oil', 'chang', 'googl', 'oil', 'consumpt', 'went', 'regular', 'dealer', 'oil', 'consumpt', 'test', 'startedat', '1200', 'mile', 'bit', '13', 'qt', 'low', 'video', 'tape', 'crappi', 'servic', 'rep', 'look', 'dip', 'stick', 'hope', 'final', 'nail', 'dismiss', 'letter', 'anyway', 'went', 'anoth', 'rep', 'told', '13', 'warrant', 'engin', 'block', 'order', 'consumpt', 'test', 'wait', 'week', 'call', 'updat', 'block', 'never', 'order', 'spoke', 'servic', 'manag', 'said', 'test', 'complet', 'told', 'look', 'first', 'line', 'test', 'said', 'low', 'order', 'block', 'also', 'told', 'level', '250', 'mile', 'later', 'middl', 'dot', 'dip', 'stick', 'could', 'hear', 'valv', 'knock', 'also', 'told', 'twit', 'never', 'ad', 'oil', 'bring', 'level', 'back', 'want', 'drive', 'car', 'thing', 'blew', 'say', 'soyou', 'record', 'short', 'tale', 'bring', 'car', 'back', 'loaner', 'forrest', 'drive', '23', 'week', 'car', 'repairedi', 'also', 'mention', 'servic', 'manag', '36', 'normal', 'complaint', '25', 'said', 'correct', 'wonder', 'mani', '36', 'engin', 'owner', 'oil', 'chang', 'frequent', 'never', 'realiz', 'engin', 'problem', 'warranti', 'never', 'heard', 'anin', 'statement', 'normal', 'oil', 'consumpt', '16', 'year', 'old', 'durango', 'never', 'consum', 'drop', 'oil', 'changesim', 'go', 'monitor', 'site', 'see', 'find', 'anoth', '36', 'report', 'problem']"

When I was a mechanic you could always tell a Subaru was coming due to a common part failure which caused the car to make a distinctive sound. Well when I looked at the car and drove it I was impressed. Not after the second oil change. Every three thousand miles I need to add a quart.I called the dealer who informed me this was within tolerance. I told him my F150 goes 10k between oil changes and does not use a drop of oil. I could have the dealer do an oil change and then bring it in every 500 miles for them to check. If the consumption was to great they had a fix which sounds more like a band aid.The car now has 65K as my wife does a lot of driving. Just replaced the original tires at 55k. Rotated every 7500 miles. Going to change plugs at 67k and front pads.Well we will not be buying another Subaru as I feel the oil consumption is unacceptable.

Oct 01,2014,Outback,Excessive Oil Consumption,"30,000 miles","First and last Subaru. Found out the hard way the engine burns oil. Subaru tried to tell me it is normal consumption to burn 1/3 quart of oil per 1200 miles, that would mean that you could be adding  just under 2 quarts of oil in between oil changes and it would be considered normal. We have had a pleasant experience with the dealerships up until the moment I brought up the oil loss. Then I was stone walled when requesting information and have been treated like a leper ever since. The best thing you can do is trade your car in for a loss, the next best thing is let them replace the engine block on your brand new car (it will never run the same, I also have read that the problem persists even after this fix). The worst possible outcome is if it consumes just under the limit set by Subaru that you can't get the problem fixed, but you get to feed oil into your car, so that once it is out of warranty you get to start replacing O2 sensors, spark plugs, and catalytic converters like band aids. Not to mention the dirty combustion chambers and fouled valve seats and the decreased gas mileage.I talked my wife into buying this car, told her it was a 300,000 mile car...It will need a new engine block after 40,000 miles, and this is common.","['first', 'last', 'subaru', 'found', 'hard', 'way', 'engin', 'burn', 'oil', 'subaru', 'tri', 'tell', 'normal', 'consumpt', 'burn', '13', 'quart', 'oil', 'per', '1200', 'mile', 'would', 'mean', 'could', 'ad', '2', 'quart', 'oil', 'oil', 'chang', 'would', 'consid', 'normal', 'pleasant', 'experi', 'dealership', 'moment', 'brought', 'oil', 'loss', 'stone', 'wall', 'request', 'inform', 'treat', 'like', 'leper', 'ever', 'sinc', 'best', 'thing', 'trade', 'car', 'loss', 'next', 'best', 'thing', 'let', 'replac', 'engin', 'block', 'brand', 'new', 'car', 'never', 'run', 'also', 'read', 'problem', 'persist', 'even', 'fix', 'worst', 'possibl', 'outcom', 'consum', 'limit', 'set', 'subaru', 'cant', 'get', 'problem', 'fix', 'get', 'feed', 'oil', 'car', 'warranti', 'get', 'start', 'replac', 'o2', 'sensor', 'spark', 'plug', 'catalyt', 'convert', 'like', 'band', 'aid', 'mention', 'dirti', 'combust', 'chamber', 'foul', 'valv', 'seat', 'decreas', 'ga', 'mileagei', 'talk', 'wife', 'buy', 'car', 'told', '300000', 'mile', 'carit', 'need', 'new', 'engin', 'block', '40000', 'mile', 'common']"
Jul 31,2014,Outback 4 Door Wagon 2.5L I,Excessive Oil Consumption,"37,527 miles","Took my car in for 'oil consumption test'. The car had been driven 1157 miles since the last oil change, and had consumed 0.4 quarts of oil. I was told that the oil consumption was ""good news-well within specifications"". Also was told that the oil consumption test had to be done ONLY at 1200 miles, and since I will be taking it on a 3000 mile trip next week, it will have to be started over when I return. I asked if I could have it done at other dealerships along the way, and was told ""No. The same technician has to do it each time."" I asked for a copy of the test, and refused to leave until they gave it to me. It is unsigned and I intend to go back this morning and ask the service manager (Josh Frick, Tom Woods Subaru, Indianapolis, Indiana) to sign it. Wish me luck on that one.Nevertheless, they mislead me on the following (from the hard copy of the Consolidated Engine Oil Consumption Test):1. There is nothing that states that it has to be done at exactly 1200 miles. In fact there is a very specific set of instructions on how to calculate any mileage, thus converting it to 1200 miles. The story about having to start the test over every time we don't get it there at the right time is untrue.2. There is nothing about the same technician or dealership having to do the oil consumption test.3. By their specifications, we failed the test.I have contacted BBB, Angies List, and WISH TV investigative reporters about this. Since we live just south of the factory where this beast was manufactured (Lafayette, IN.) I don't think we are going to get any local support.The factory and the dealership make a big deal about being ""green"", yet the cars they manufacture are burning a lot of oil.

Feb 18,2005,Cooper 2 Door Hatchbac,Water On Floor Shorted Out Wiring Harness,"18,000 miles","Our area was hit by a very bad ice storm and the car was covered in ice. All of the windows and the sun roof were closed during this storm. Initially, the windows and sun roof would not operate because they were covered with a thick coating of ice. After the ice was cleared, I drove the car on very wet roads. Upon returning home, I discovered that there was water on the floor in the back seat (on the passanger side). The car dealership was notified and they said to let the car dry out -- they did not think there would be a problem. However, several weeks later the car developed electrical problems. The radio and the power windows would not work. The car was taken to the dealership, and they said the electrical problem was the result of the water in the car. They claim that water leaked into the wiring harness, which is on the floor of the car. The entire system needs to be replaced at a cost of over $4000. They insisted that the doors are properly sealed and the only way the water could have entered the car was if a window was left open. However, it was the dead of winter (no reason for the windows to be down) and there was no indication of water spots on the seats, walls or ceiling of the car. I am positive that the water leaked in from another (unknown) source. I am also stunned that water on the floor could have cause an electrical failure.

Feb 14,2005,Cooper 2 Door Hatchbac,Water On Floor Shorted Out Wiring Harness,"18,000 miles","Our area was hit by a very bad ice storm and the car was covered in ice. All of the windows and the sun roof were closed during this storm. Initially, the windows and sun roof would not operate because they were covered with a thick coating of ice. After the ice was cleared, I drove the car on very wet roads. Upon returning home, I discovered that there was water on the floor in the back seat (on the passanger side). The car dealership was notified and they said to let the car dry out -- they did not think there would be a problem. However, several weeks later the car developed electrical problems. The radio and the power windows would not work. The car was taken to the dealership, and they said the electrical problem was the result of the water in the car. They claim that water leaked into the wiring harness, which is on the floor of the car. The entire system needs to be replaced at a cost of over $4000. They insisted that the doors are properly sealed and the only way the water could have entered the car was if a window was left open. However, it was the dead of winter (no reason for the windows to be down) and there was no indication of water spots on the seats, walls or ceiling of the car. I am positive that the water leaked in from another (unknown) source. I am also stunned that water on the floor could have cause an electrical failure.

Now yesterday the vehicle would not start again. On Sunday my husband used the lift gate and also we took our granddaughter to church and she was buckled in the back seat. I am unsure if one of those caused the battery to draw done again. The vehicle worked Monday morning. I drove it for 10 minutes that day; then it set for the rest of the day. I know that it takes awhile for the battery to drain so I believe that is why it did not start yesterday. My son said I should undo the negative cable every night and re-connect in the morning. I do not believe I should have to do that, I have filed several complaints with Chrysler to no avail. Then I see that there was a lawsuit filed against them on this issue. Why were not all the people notified, This is the second Town and Country I have owned. The first one I had I never had a problem with that is why i bought another one. I do not believe I will purchase another one not after all the headaches with this one. These past few months alone I have spent over 2500.00 on this vehicle.

We are the 2nd owners of the van, it had approx. 60,000miles when we bought it, we purchased an extended warranty at purchase. I am the primary driver of the van, about Aug. 2015 we started to have issues with the van having intermittent electrical issues. We had the battery replaced & the alternator was tested; it tested good. The problems seemed to have resolved themselves. Then it started having intermitten issues again at the end of Oct. beg. Nov.; the biggest of these intermitten issues(both times was not starting). We took it to have the code(s) read to see if it was throwing a code. However, the checks always came back the same, ""No codes"". Then as the problem progressed the van stalled on me in the middle of a 45mph road, as I was stopped at a red light with my kids in the car. Then a few days to a week later it stalled on me in my neighborhood going 10mph, I was barely able to coast it to the side of the road & eventually get it to restart. About a week later it went from every few days to a week or so of going out to take my kids to school & not being able to start my van, to it being an everyday issue & being harder & harder to get it to start or stay started once it would finally start. We took it to our dealership, about 12/5/15 to leave it there until they repaired the van. At that point I did not feel that my van was safe for daily commuting.

Sounded like it wanted to start but wouldn't. It ended up starting up, but the issue with starting became intermittent and a safety and dependability concern. Took the vehicle to a local automotive shop and they recommended taking it to the dealership, they believed it was a module issue, they said fuel filter and fuel pump looked fine. Had vehicle towed to the dealership, probably could've got the vehicle to start up after several tries but wasn't sure what was wrong with it and didn't know if it would just stop while driving. Once vehicle got to the dealership they kept it to diagnose, called us following day and told us they would need to replace the fuel pump at a total cost of $843.They called on Saturday, September 1st to let us know it was ready for pick up, got to the dealership and started the vehicle up and the same problem persisted as to when we dropped it off in the first place. Today, September 4th we received a call from the dealership saying that they placed our original fuel pump back into the vehicle and diagnosed it with a TIPM failure, the cost will increase to $1,111.00.

Jul 30,2016,Sorento SXL 3.3L V6 Awd,Engine Blown,"59,506 miles","I was driving my vehicle to Amarillo,TX and the trip is about 100 miles from where I live. Shortly after I left home my A/C stopped working and would only blow warm air, I had an appointment the following week to get the 60,000 mile service, so I just added to the things they would have to look at because it was working intermittently prior to that. About 55 miles into the trip while my cruise control was set my vehicle started losing power, there was no warning lights or indicator that there was a problem. I pulled over to the side of the highway and noticed smoke coming out of the hood. I wasn't in a town and it was 95 degrees outside. While on the phone with Kia roadside assistance a state trooper pulled up behind me, roadside assistance told me that it would be 90 minutes to get a tow truck to me and at that time the state trooper told me he could have one there in 20 minutes, so instead of waiting on the side of the road for 90 minutes I let the trooper get a tow for me. The vehicle was towed to the same dealer that I bought it from, this happened on a Saturday, so they couldn't look at it until Monday. Kia did not have a loaner vehicle and since I was stranded and due to the time, I had to rent a vehicle from the airport, which was $300 a week. Monday they called and told me that it would need a new engine and they had to see if Kia would cover it, 5 days later they said they would cover it, but in the meantime I am still having to pay for a rental. My car was towed there on 30 Jul and was not finished until 24 Aug. It is now 7 Sep and I am still waiting on a decision from Kia to reimburse me for the tow and rental expenses. I was told that Kia would reimburse $25 a day if I rent a non Kia vehicle and $35 a day if I rent a Kia, I did not find a rental for less than $50 a day. I live in a small town, the closest rental agency is 30 miles away and there is only one agency in the area, so I'm lucky if they even have a car available, let alone it being a Kia. I have more I can say but I think people can get the picture. I loved my car, but after my experience with how they do business I will never buy a Kia again.","['drive', 'vehicl', 'amarillotx', 'trip', '100', 'mile', 'live', 'shortli', 'left', 'home', 'ac', 'stop', 'work', 'would', 'blow', 'warm', 'air', 'appoint', 'follow', 'week', 'get', '60000', 'mile', 'servic', 'ad', 'thing', 'would', 'look', 'work', 'intermitt', 'prior', '55', 'mile', 'trip', 'cruis', 'control', 'set', 'vehicl', 'start', 'lose', 'power', 'warn', 'light', 'indic', 'problem', 'pull', 'side', 'highway', 'notic', 'smoke', 'come', 'hood', 'wasnt', 'town', '95', 'degre', 'outsid', 'phone', 'kia', 'roadsid', 'assist', 'state', 'trooper', 'pull', 'behind', 'roadsid', 'assist', 'told', 'would', '90', 'minut', 'get', 'tow', 'truck', 'time', 'state', 'trooper', 'told', 'could', 'one', '20', 'minut', 'instead', 'wait', 'side', 'road', '90', 'minut', 'let', 'trooper', 'get', 'tow', 'vehicl', 'tow', 'dealer', 'bought', 'happen', 'saturday', 'couldnt', 'look', 'monday', 'kia', 'loaner', 'vehicl', 'sinc', 'strand', 'due', 'time', 'rent', 'vehicl', 'airport', '300', 'week', 'monday', 'call', 'told', 'would', 'need', 'new', 'engin', 'see', 'kia', 'would', 'cover', '5', 'day', 'later', 'said', 'would', 'cover', 'meantim', 'still', 'pay', 'rental', 'car', 'tow', '30', 'jul', 'finish', '24', 'aug', '7', 'sep', 'still', 'wait', 'decis', 'kia', 'reimburs', 'tow', 'rental', 'expens', 'told', 'kia', 'would', 'reimburs', '25', 'day', 'rent', 'non', 'kia', 'vehicl', '35', 'day', 'rent', 'kia', 'find', 'rental', 'less', '50', 'day', 'live', 'small', 'town', 'closest', 'rental', 'agenc', '30', 'mile', 'away', 'one', 'agenc', 'area', 'im', 'lucki', 'even', 'car', 'avail', 'let', 'alon', 'kia', 'say', 'think', 'peopl', 'get', 'pictur', 'love', 'car', 'experi', 'busi', 'never', 'buy', 'kia']"

The dealer told us that Kia had the best warranty and only suggested oil changes at 7500-10,000 mile intervals. I purchased the oil and my father changed the oil 2 more times once in July 2014 and again September 2015. This vehicle was purchased for my wife who gave birth to our son three days after purchasing the vehicle. It was not driven often because she did not return to work until October 2013. As a teacher she only worked until May 2014 and did not return to work until September 2015. She worked less than 10 miles from home therefore our mileage was low. Around December 10, 2015 my wife said the car was â€œacting funnyâ€. I told her to come home and I would have my dad look at it. When she came home the car appeared fine no lights, no warnings, no sounds that wasnâ€™t normal. The next day we were driving and the car it just stopped on the side of the road. We had it towed to the dealership. The dealer took several days to tell us that the engine was blown because we didnâ€™t change the oil enough. We were not due for another oil change for 5000 miles. After a month of waiting Kia told me they were not fixing under warranty. I have spoke to many people, dealerships, junk yards, mechanics... all say after only 30000 on the car no way it should have that much engine sludge to blow the engine even IF it was never changed.

According to case manager at Chrysler its not uncommon for the ""power train"" dept as she called it, to ask for multiple photos and samples of oil, etc to make sure its not a neglect issue or other, and that can take weeks back and forth with the dealership. I thought was such bs but after all this im semi-happy now that they are giving me a new engine(although not too happy). The initial problem was misfire in cylinder 2. The service rep calls me later after the diagnostic and tells me my engine is blown and has lost compression.WOW! only 55k and its blown? Ok so although that sucks i had some hope as I bought the jeep new with the Lifetime power train warranty and a Mopar added Careplus service warranty. I dont know how that all played out into them getting me a new engine.I did however contact Chrysler alot and was even about to have an attorney who is family (no cost) to write them a letter that we would pursue legal action with a DTPA especially since alot of the dealerships apparantley knew about the issue yet kept the jeeps on the lot instead of doing the right thing and fixing it then and there. Seems like they are selling them to get numbers up and then dealing with the problem later. looks good on paper until the customer comes back and is pissed to find out that its a known issue and also jump through all the hoops to get the repair approvedand WAIT 45 days and more with no loaner no rental for a chrysler derived issue.So im waiting for the engine to get to the dealership still and from there it takes a week, which will likely be more because we all know how that goes.My thing is this, the defective head is a KNOWN problem for Chrysler and anyone experiencing the issue should have it replaced promptly and be put in a rental instead of having to wait over 40 days.Im not too sure how long anyone else has taken but this is my experience.After all it is a manufacturing issue or design flaw or who knows but its not the owners fault.Hope this gave some hope and maybe you can cite this to try and get a new engine also.

Feb 18,2016,Wrangler Unlimited 3.6L V6,Head Has To Be Replaced,"23,673 miles","I purchased my jeep wrangler in 2012 brand new . My first new vehicle ever. It is a right hand right jeep Gecko Green awesome color . I was so in love. I am a rural route mail carrier in Iowa. It made my job so much easier. WELL at 23,673 miles the engine light came on . I was very concerned so to the dealership we went. AND a new head was going to have to be replaced. # 6, # 2 , # 4 cylinder was misfiring. Code P0306 was found. I entered the dealership on 2/6/13 and did not get mt jeep back until 3/19/13 WOW 51 days later. Then as time went on all of my idiot lights came on, the traction light, engine light several others. My wiring harness needed to be replaced again and again with a total of 4 times. The real reason WHY was never explained to me. I was told once that a mouse got on my engine and chewed on the wire. I said REALLY, I think that the mouse walks on two legs and carries a wrench. I was working six day a week at that time No way in heck that mouse had any time to do that. A LIE . One of many that I am receiving from this dealership . So after many times returning to this dealership that problem was fixed FINALLY!!! So before the jeep reached 100,000 miles I thought I should get a extended warranty on the jeep and Chrysler would not even consider me for any warranty. If I wanted a warranty it was going to cost me around $4,000 to $5,000. I called Chrysler Service Department and got a case number and the battle was on . After weeks of discussion I received 3 warranties, engine, transmission, and electrical, four years unlimited miles. I thought GREAT! So now I have had my jeep for four years I have 148,540 miles now the jeep . I have a head problem again. I get my jeep serviced every 3,000 miles give or take a few. I believe in preventive maintenance and that did not help. So the jeep is back into the dealership again. It has been in there for 8 days now . Went in on 2/12/2106 at 3:30 as of 2/19/2016 a inspector showed up to look at the head but it was not the way he wanted it - to be able to take pictures of it -so I am waiting again . I am now doing a lot of research on this problem. Let me added that before the jeep- I drove a 1989 bronco II for 3 years with over 100,000 when I purchased it and NEVER had a engine issue. Then I purchased a 1996 GMC jimmy with over a 100,000 miles and NEVER had engine problem and drove that until transmision went out at 206,000 miles. Then I purchased a 2000 pretty blue Chevy Blazer with 27,000 miles and still driving it on mail route today at 185,000 and NEVER had the any troubles with the engine. UNBELIEVABLE 16 years !!! ALL of the miles on the blazer are mail route miles. I never had another vehicle drive. SO WHY I am having to replace TWO heads on A 2012 Jeep ???? So if any one out there can explain WHY- to me- PLEASE do. I need some advise on what I should do about this . I am still making a $563.00 a month payment on a very unreliable vehicle. I purchased a brand new vehicle to be dependable and it is not- at all. Down time kills me. At least I fought for a warranty and it is not completely coming out of my pocket.

After we got the car we realized that it was not very sound proof and that road and wind noise was more than we expected. In addition, we paid a hefty sum for the navigation system that we quit using because it sent us to strange places, sometimes on the other side of town. It also did not have major highways shown on the map. Too often it showed us driving through uncharted land. When my daughter stopped by and told me she had an engine oil light on, I checked her oil and it was down 1 quart. I told her she needed to check it out with the Subaru dealer. The next day I received the letter in the mail about the class action lawsuit on the poorly designed motor. I read the letter that claimed Subaru knew of the design defect in their motors and, essentially they would be punished if the judge accepted the settlement. That is essentially, they will extend the warranty on motor, etc. on effected cars to 100,000. Sounds fair, but unfortunately, the definition and determination was to be left up to the dealers to follow Subaru Guidelines if they wanted to be paid for work. In jest, I told my wife that they will be doing oil consumption tests and will be overfilling the oil. So, I asked my daughter to stop by after the dealer said she needed to do an oil consumption test - and they changed the oil. She stopped by - what do you think I found after 4-5 checks of oil level. The oil was overfilled by a little more than 1/2 quart. Obviously, when she returned to the dealership after 2000 miles (or was it 1500) she was told that its oil consumption was not a problem.

The oil lift tube has a screen in it that had become restricted with the crystalized particles (sludge?) of oil. Poor design only gives approx 2.5 square inches of screen to pass through. Anyway, we removed the pump and lift tube. I went ahead and replaced the pump since I was in there. The lift tube was let soak in carb. cleaning solution, then cleaned.

Sep 30,2016,Fiesta SE,Jerking/Shuddering/Hesitation When Accelerating,"56,500 miles","So a couple weeks back, I run the vehicle health report in my 2011 Ford Fiesta SE - hatch, if anyone cares. just for the sake of playing with the features and because i'm almost at 57k, and figured I should be getting ready for a checkup. Everything checked out wonderfully.However, right after, the ""seemingly normal"" rattle that my car used to give off while driving started to become significantly worse and way louder and noticeable immediately after this. Not sure if the health report is to blame, but it was the last thing I had done before things got crazy. The car at low speeds sounds ridiculous (loud, grinding, shuddering), it revs super high (like 3-5k just barely going 15-20mph), idles high and shakes the whole car. The gears slip when upshifting and they jerk REALLY HARD when downshifting. It feels dangerous driving in the city, because I'll try to slow down behind someone and it jerks forward and revs really hard and forces me to apply the brakes very hard to stop it from slamming into them. Upshifting is weird too, because it's unpredictable. If I try to merge into a highway or switch lanes, I need to wait for a HUGE gap before I trust that I can make it because sometimes it picks up, sometimes it doesn't. Sometimes I can't go more than 25mph then it suddenly slips and jerks into gear and goes faster. Needless to say the mechanic found nothing wrong with the car and zero fault codes. Then he replaced my alternator belt because it was pretty cooked.This went on for a week or so. I then ran the vehicle health report in the car again to see if it found any issues... nothing. Within 24 hours warning lights started to pop up. Not sure if the health report identified the issues or created the issues. I went ahead and googled a bunch of stuff after all my lights started going crazy and found these things to be linked to an FSA that Ford put out for the TCM. I went to my nearest dealer and they said they'd fix it and that it was covered. Lo and behold, I get a call saying it can't be fixed. The woman I spoke to tells me now that my alternator isn't charging the vehicle enough and the MAF sensor and throttle body are faulty and she can't update the TCM until those are fixed. They quoted me $1650 + tax (about $1800 with NY tax) - and I bet they'd expect a tip after that. They also said that this might not actually fix the problem. That it's just what they ""think is going to help."" So if I spend $1800 fixing the car and the problem recurs (like I've seen in a lot of complaints on here and other sites) - then what? I'm down a ton of money for no reason. This thing feels like a burden and I'm scared to really use it. I found a possible fix online for the alternator issue which involves buffing down the painted slab of metal that is grounding the battery, but I haven't tried it. I also revved the engine very hard on the highway like another fix said (which actually seemed to have helped a lot with upshifting, it still jerks and hesitates to pick up, but it seems a tiny bit better).

Apr 12,2011,CR-V SE 4,Unwanted Acceleration When Braking,"1,000 miles","This was my 4th Honda CrV. Car suddenly, but intermittently, would accelerate upon braking. Naturally, dealer could not duplicate the problem. I feared to drive this hazard and traded it immediately. I would like to buy a new CrV but simply cannot trust Honda. By the way, the CRV I test drove and thought I bought, turned out to be a different car. I checked the vin number on my purchase order and the dealer had substituted an identical new Crv indicating it didn't matter. The one I test drove and thought I purchased was made in Ohio, the one they gave me was made in Japan. I wonder if this hidden defect is associated with production sites? I didn't report this originally to anybody but the dealer. The dealer reported that they had heard about this problem, but hadn't experienced it and could not replicate it with my car. I have periodically monitored this site, and decided to add my complaint, albeit several years later. To this day every time I hit the brakes on my current carI wonder if they will work properly. As an expediency I traded the Crv for another Honda model with the same dealer and lost money in the process, but because it was fast and easy, and to its credit the dealer was accommodating. Nevertheless, I doubt I would ever trust Honda again with the wide variety of quality products out there today. I wonder what happened to the person who bought the very slightly used Crv and whether the dealer disclosed the undiagnosed braking/acceleration problem. Thanks.

I thought I lost the oil cap or oil pan screw but it was the engine burning the oil. Every 1000km I had to add 1 litre to 1.5 litres of 10W-30 oil while the car calls for 5W-30. I started an excel spreadsheet to track my dipstick levels every Sunday morning before I drive to track it. Since my car was just over the 100,000km warranty Toyota wouldn't help unless I could produce every oil change receipt to have partial coverage paid and even then it would have cost me $3000 to fix without the receipts. It's now August 2013 and I'm getting about 800km before adding 1-2 litres of oil as well as Lucas Oil additive to help reduce burning. It's cheaper then the alternative. Other than that the car runs fine. My engine light just came on a week ago but I figure it's the O2 sensor from all the burning oil. To date I would say roughly I have added 106 litres of 10W-30 to the engine between oil changes ever 5000km. Yes, it's annoying to check this each week, but now I have a usage timeline and when I get a new car I will start a new spreadsheet from day 1 that has one page for services at what mileage with invoice numbers and a second page parts I may get like wiper blades, air filters, etc and page three is my oil consumption based on points on the dipstick and mileage recording.

The stick was completely dry but no oil light or engine light ever came on. I took it to a Toyota dealership and they did a oil test and had me run it for 500 miles to see how much would be used.

I came upon this site by accident looking for answers to the problem. I thought I better add my car to this complaint site, right away. So here's hoping Toyota will pay attention and salvage us as possible bad publicity to their reputation. Thank-you so much for this site and the opportunity to make a legitimate gripe to Toyota.","['purchas', '2002', 'toyota', 'corolla', 'new', 'start', 'use', 'oil', 'everi', 'week', 'never', 'time', 'check', 'repair', 'thought', 'statist', 'burn', 'toyota', 'lemon', 'otherwis', 'run', 'great', 'check', 'ga', 'fill', 'oil', 'came', 'upon', 'site', 'accid', 'look', 'answer', 'problem', 'thought', 'better', 'add', 'car', 'complaint', 'site', 'right', 'away', 'here', 'hope', 'toyota', 'pay', 'attent', 'salvag', 'us', 'possibl', 'bad', 'public', 'reput', 'thankyou', 'much', 'site', 'opportun', 'make', 'legitim', 'gripe', 'toyota']"

Mar 10,2012,Corolla LE 1.8L,Engine Uses Excessive Oil,"118,000 miles","I have been a toyota owner most of my adult life. I also have a 2005 toyota 4-runner and a 2008 toyota tundra. I have spent a total $84,000 on toyota vehicles and these problems I am reading about with the corollas is really pissing me off. My 2002 corolla is burning excessive oil so I took it to my mechanic. It started using oil probably at 100,000 miles and now it is like a quart every couple hundred miles. My mechanic said it has excessive blow by meaning rings and or pistons are shot. He gave me a price of $3,000.00 for a used motor with 59,000 miles on it. I thought that was crazy especially if this is common problem with the 1.8 liter. I would replace my blown motor with another piece of s++t one. I think we should all get together and bring a lawsuit against toyota and make them recall these engines until all of us are satisfied. I am really considering selling my current toyotas and buying american again.","['toyota', 'owner', 'adult', 'life', 'also', '2005', 'toyota', '4runner', '2008', 'toyota', 'tundra', 'spent', 'total', '84000', 'toyota', 'vehicl', 'problem', 'read', 'corolla', 'realli', 'piss', '2002', 'corolla', 'burn', 'excess', 'oil', 'took', 'mechan', 'start', 'use', 'oil', 'probabl', '100000', 'mile', 'like', 'quart', 'everi', 'coupl', 'hundr', 'mile', 'mechan', 'said', 'excess', 'blow', 'mean', 'ring', 'piston', 'shot', 'gave', 'price', '300000', 'use', 'motor', '59000', 'mile', 'thought', 'crazi', 'especi', 'common', 'problem', '18', 'liter', 'would', 'replac', 'blown', 'motor', 'anoth', 'piec', 'st', 'one', 'think', 'get', 'togeth', 'bring', 'lawsuit', 'toyota', 'make', 'recal', 'engin', 'us', 'satisfi', 'realli', 'consid', 'sell', 'current', 'toyota', 'buy', 'american']"
